# Starship submission

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-16 08:50:16)

I have a question/idea, and IÂ´d like to see everyones opinion on it.
In the "old" Galaxy, there currently exists some "unfair" elements in starships and such, since a lot of the ships in SotG hasnÂ´t actually been made using the rules in that same book. However, with the Kalium Galaxy, we can have a chance to correct that. My suggestion is simply that we say that all ships submitted has to be constructed by following the rules from SotG. This means they cannot be for instance, a "modified" X-Wing. They could however, be modified version of any ship already accepted into the Kalium Galaxy.
It might just be me, but I get really pissed of sometimes when I put down a lot of time creating a starfighter by the rules, and then I realize that I canÂ´t survive a hyperspace trip since I only have 2 days of cinsumables, when the average trip (with a class 1 hyperdrive) takes 3 days, but still most hyperspace capable fighters in SotG has at least a week of consumables. In order to get that on my fighter, I have to spend all my EP on the "Extended Range" modification, forsaking any/most other systems in the process.
Thoughts?

what if we ruled that starfighters couldn't have hyperdrives all together. They have to be carried into battles and deployed from a carrier.

> what if we ruled that starfighters couldn&#39;t have hyperdrives all together. They have to be carried into battles and deployed from a carrier.

ThatÂ´s one way to go, but I really prefer it if they can be equiped with hyperdrives. As a character, IÂ´d like to be able to do like Luke and just take my X-Wing and go off somewhere. Not everyone wants to have big ships to travel around.

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-16 10:31:58)

It should be rare then. I mean look how our governments clamp down on mil spec gear. You would never see a fighter pilot hop in his jet and fly home for the weekend in it. I also think the price for hyperspace tech should be expensive.

Does it really have to be that rare? Look at the rebels, their fighters travels through hyperspace on their own at all times. I suppose that is why they invented "nonstandard modifications". Hyperdrive is a typical thing that is nonstandard on anything that donÂ´t have it from the beginning. However, if you design a ship to have a hyperdrive from scratch, it should be ok to upgrade it later on. Too bad that the rules for consumables donÂ´t seem to agree with smaller fighters making it through hyperspace on their own.

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-16 11:04:07)

> Too bad that the rules for consumables donÂ´t seem to agree with smaller fighters making it through hyperspace on their own.

maybe thats a sign. The only reason Luke and the Jedi are able to make long trips is due to the force trance. Plus you could easily stretch two days of food out and make it last 4-5 days anyway. You'll just be hungry when you get there. You ever think about where your gonna go take a crap on these long 3-4 day flights in deep space in your snub fighter? It has got to reek and does consumables include depends?
Anyway I got off the topic of your original post
I think we should be as creative as possible with this new galaxy. The more lucas-verse stuff we leave behind the better. This is our galaxy using wizards saga rules so I think original ships only is the way to go

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-16 11:21:06)

Ir would have been a sign if it wasnÂ´t for the fact that quite a lot of starfighters still have been given 1 week of consumables, including most rebel fighters. However, most such fighters have a class x1 hyperdrive. Also a few things suggests (now that I read it through reeally thorough) that hyperspace travel uses less consumables. The TIE Defender can make a hyperspace jump in on average 6 days (2days minimum), but only has 2 days of consumables.
But yeah, the real question was if we were to be consistent in using the rules to base all ships of off, and I think that we should.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-16 12:25:21)

An easy way to solve this would be to make hyper drive expensive as hell. Only the rich would us them and military, but because of the costs involved equipping squad of fighters with hyper drives would be an astronomical waste of resources.
There are a variety of ways to explain why they would be expensive:
-hyper tech on this level is new to the galaxy
-hyper drive components are rare
-a mega company has cornered the hyper drive market

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-16 12:30:36)

I like the idea of hyper drive being a newer tech. That would explain why there is so many small goverments and nothing as large as the Republic or Empire

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-16 12:31:46)

That would be one way to do it, but I feel as if it would limit players a bit not being able to just go where they wants to (provided they have a ship), without first finding a LOT of credits.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-16 12:34:44)

> That would be one way to do it, but I feel as if it would limit players a bit not being able to just go where they wants to (provided they have a ship), without first finding a LOT of credits.

Not exactly.... Though it would make a group of player character adventurers much more exotic. It is easy to insert adventure here where the players uncover a hyper drive. Maybe it was in an enemy strong hold or lost tech buried in the sand. Credits are only one explanation to acquire goodies.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-16 12:41:15)

Yeah, that sounds about right. I like it too actually. So hyperdrives would be limited to larger vessels, mostly military, and on the occasion to some smaller craft, such as a rich nobles private ship.

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-16 12:44:38)

Its a great way to keep your players from running rampant as well. Who wants players just running around all whilly nilly.

The GMs donÂ´t, but the players might feel less free... :

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-16 12:49:40)

Well if players are the actors then GM's are the stage and the props and the extras ect.
Player's are never really free anyway

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-16 17:52:03)

For my two cents, I say that this is an interesting idea. However the rules can be somewhat confusing and so building a ship can be time consuming -_-
I'm unsure how most of the statted ships in there could be created with the rules

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-16 18:25:00)

They can't be, actually. Heck, I can't make a ship with *or* without them. I can't figure out where half the stats are supposed to come from. It's confusing. I'll just let everyone else worry about the ships.
But, for what its worth (not even two cents) I like the "hyperdrives are new" idea. Its cool and sets if well apart from the Lucas-verse.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-16 19:33:04)

Like said, the problem is they canÂ´t. Other than the consumables issue though, IÂ´m more or less ok with the rules, even though some ships bends them in all possible ways. This is why IÂ´d like us to all follow the rules when making new ships NOT mod old ships. IÂ´ll gladly help with the rules if you have questions.

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-17 22:38:17)

Well. I suppose I'm for the idea if everyone agrees to it...
for now, some questions.
1: turbolaser batteries use a lot of EPs considering it's 5 or 10 EPs per gun, does this mean that they cheat by firelinks? i.e. instead of 20 EP for four turbolasers use 7 EP from firelinking.
2: Hangar space they also use a lot of EPs to carry anything. It's 48 EPs to carry a single (gargantuan) squadron on a cruiser. 96 RPs for a single (huge) squadron on a frigate sized ship. Does this mean that carrying fighters or any support craft whatsover are limited to the largest and quite lightly equipped ships only?

batteries are different from fire-links. batteries are actual weapons, while fire-links are extra weapons represented in increased damage.
hangar space is so messed up I don't even want to go there

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-18 07:33:09)

I know that, but how otherwise how else can you fit that many 'actual' guns on most capital ships in the SotG??
So I take it your opinion is that it's not an acceptable way of filling a ship full of turbolaser batteries then? :P
Shall we house rule a whole stack of things if we're gonna mess about with these great rules for buildings ships then?

---

I can make a new ship in SotG that has similar amounts of guns to a star destroyer
and fire-link only gives your guns more damage, but doesn't increase the amount in a battery.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-18 12:30:00)

HavenÂ´t tried to make a lot of capital ships yet, IÂ´m more into smaller ships. But it seems doable, according to SotG, an ISD has 80 guns. Messing with cargo space (it only has 36,000 of 200,000 tons left) it should be no problem.

Okay okay, but fluff wise its still called extra guns :P
so eating into cargo space huh? What's your take on hangar space then Anthrax?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-18 13:13:31)

Like I said, I havenÂ´t looked into larger ships that much, but IÂ´ve heard that hangar space is a real mess.

that doesn't work because stock battlecruisers start with *20000*, not 200000

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-18 14:52:14)

Nah, I looked wrong on both numbers. So thatÂ´s just another ship where the stats are just put out as desired then.

---

### **Rebaav** (2008-10-18 15:36:42)

I like what I'm reading here. Hyperdrives were ancient and refined technology and commonplace in the Galaxy Far Far Away. Refined to a point where the devices themselves are smaller than half a breadbox and fit into fighters. One of the things I've been asking about in many threads is how is Kallium *different* from GFFA. If this is supposed to be a different and seperate galaxy then this could be a defining feature. Hyperdrives are NOT commonplace: different.
As for the confusion over the ship creation rules what if we open a thread and have a new ship created there? Each step of the process discussed and referenced. That way we could arrive at a convention for submissions. With clearer guidelines for submissions that would help people submit content (it would help me alot anyway).

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-18 16:25:13)

Well the only convention I was looking for in the starship section was that we stick to following the creation rules, and not (as the only currently submitted starship) designs vessels that are modified versions of the ones in SotG, as these ships seldomly follows all the rules in creation. That, and a unison format on all submissions.
If someone would like a guide in how to create a starship, I think I can help out though.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-18 18:03:24)

I think I need that. Straship creation has me so messed up that I don't even bother, I just use the ships "as is" in SotG.

I can also help, what about it confuses you?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-18 18:29:39)

I have to say that I still canÂ´t figure out a formula for Grapple modifiers, does anybody knows what the rules says?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-18 18:35:14)

I can't figure out where some of their numbers are coming from, and Grapple's one of them. I thought it was supposed to be Base Attack + Strength Modifier, but then most of their numbers are wrong.
There are others that confuse me, but I can't remember which ones at the moment. I'll have to get back to you once I get a chance to go over it again.

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-18 18:36:06)

BAB + STR mod + size mod (Large +5, Huge +10, Garg +15, Colossal +20, Colossal [frigate] +25, Colossal [cruiser] +30, Colossal [station] +35)
I think.

correct
most of the colossal frigate ships and above have errors in their grp mods

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-18 19:56:50)

heh, k -_-
could it be anything to do with the incorrect STR scores for stock ships or just one of the many typos (or just wrong stats) throughout the books.
I'm not altogether certain, but many of the ships could just be direct conversions from the old SotG

actually, it has to do with the grapple mods for colossal frigate (+25), colossal cruiser (+30), and colossal station (+35), hadn't existed when the book was made, and was errata'd. so a lot of those size ships don't include the extra +5, 10, or 15

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-18 20:29:19)

heh, another pretty good reason to make our own ships. To have stat blocks at hand where you know you don't have to check em over and correct numbers -_-

Yes please, a process for submission and clarification on the SotG would be outstanding. I spent more than a few days trying to figure out the rules and stats on the ship I created, and became more confused as I read. I finally decided to submit a ship with what knowledge I could figure out and hope for the best.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-19 09:49:51)

Hmm, here are some of the things I noticed about your ship RED DOOR:
[ul]
[*]It says to have "SR 55+15 for additional shields". Is there some rule on having more than one shield generator somewhere? Or was it the intention to have multiple generators?  
[*]It says that it has replaced the Sublight 1 drive with a Sublight 4 drive, but the stat block still has 1 square as speed.  
[*]The Reflex Defense is wrong, since the increased Dex only adds +2, and also, I would have preferred to write "Dex 18) rather than "Dex 14(+4 Maneuvering Thrusters".  
[*]The improved Dex should also have improved Pilot and Initiative checks.  
[*]It states that 65 tons of cargo space has been removed, but the original ship has 75 tons, and this one has 15. 75-65 /= 15.  
[*]It has the CEC manufacturing template. Sure something like the CEC might exist in the Kalium Galaxy, but still. Also, can someone tell me where to find that template, I canÂ´t seem to find it.  
[*]Some of the attack bonuses seems off. [/ul]  
ItÂ´s not really that much about rules misses, but more about forgetting to change things, and that I found some of the writing a little confusing.
But IÂ´ll try to write up a "guide" on how to create a starship using the rules later today.

CEC isn't really a template, but was mentioned in the EP section of SotG, and any ship made from it (like the corellian gunship) had 5 extra EP. but it doesn't really make sense for the Corellian Engineering Corporation to exist in the Kalium Galaxy

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-19 13:54:30)

Ah, ok. I thought it was an actual template that existed somewhere. And while we certainly can have a corporation that makes easy-to-modify ships like the CEC, I think we should not just assume they exist.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-19 14:06:21)

> Ah, ok. I thought it was an actual template that existed somewhere. And while we certainly can have a corporation that makes easy-to-modify ships like the CEC, I think we should not just assume they exist.

100% agreement with you.
so what should our standards be on creating ships? like general rules?
one I use:
when creating a stock ship, replacing a system (such as engines) you merely pay (or receive) the credit difference, rather than selling the original for 1/4 value.
also I have a formula for figuring out the hangar space a colossal frigate ship or bigger takes
Cost modifier*(1+(1.5*(n-1)))=Hangar Space
n1 (the first term) is a huge ship, n2 gargantuan, up to n6, colossal station
for colossal frigate (the biggest ship that will usually be stored in a hangar) is 50(cost mod) * 5.5(which is 1+1.5*3)=275
so a colossal frigate ship takes up 275 units of hangar space
-------------------------------------------------------
my templates for dreadnaughts (like the super star destroyer)
Str 138 Dex 10 Int 20 Speed -/1 HP 3000 DR 20 Armor +18 Crew 100000 Passengers 20000 Cargo 250000 tons Consumables 6 years Emplacement points 7000

Aye - we be needin space stations.
a thought on the dreadnoughts - maybe the template could be used occasionally in a sci-fi TV show huge alien threat style scenario

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-19 19:10:40)

OK, hereÂ´s some basic step-by-step instruction on how to create a starship using the rules presented in SotG.
***<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Starship Creation Guide</span>***
[hide]Step 1
First, write up a â€blankâ€ starship sheet or use the one below (which is good if you want to publish it on the site, as it already has all the tags in place). Just copy one from an existing ship, and replace all vaules with â€XXâ€, and remove a few things like size, type, etc. It should look something like this:

```

[b]Starship Name[/b]
Size Stock Ship Type
[b]Init[/b] +XX; [b]Senses Perception[/b] +XX
======================================================
[b]Defenses[/b] Ref XX (flat-footed XX), Fort XX; +XX Armor
[b]Hp[/b] XX; [b]DR[/b] XX; [b]Damage Threshold[/b] XX
======================================================
[b]Speed[/b] Fly XX Squares (Max Velocity XXXX km/h), Fly XX Squares (Starship Scale)

[b]Base Attack[/b] +XX; [b]Grp[/b] +XX
======================================================
[b]Abilities[/b] Str XX, Dex XX, Con - , Int XX
[b]Skills[/b] Initiative +XX, Pilot +XX, Mechanics +XX, Perception +XX, Use Computer +XX
======================================================
[b]Crew[/b] X; [b]Passengers[/b] X
[b]Cargo[/b] XX tons/kgs; [b]Consumables[/b] X days/months; [b]Carried Craft[/b] None
[b]Payload[/b] None
[b]Availability[/b] Military; [b]Cost[/b] XXXXXXX Credits

```

Step 2
Now decide which stock ship from pg 52 in SotG you want to use. For this example, IÂ´ll use the â€Shuttleâ€ stock ship. I add in all the statistics specified on pages 52-53 (not sure how to derive maximum velocity yet). The statblock now looks like this:

```

[b]Starship Name[/b]
Colossal Shuttle
[b]Init[/b] +XX; [b]Senses Perception[/b] +XX
======================================================
[b]Defenses[/b] Ref XX (flat-footed XX), Fort XX; +12 Armor
[b]Hp[/b] 120; [b]DR[/b] 15; [b]Damage Threshold[/b] XX
======================================================
[b]Speed[/b] Fly 12 Squares (Max Velocity 850 km/h), Fly 3 Squares (Starship Scale)

[b]Base Attack[/b] +XX; [b]Grp[/b] +XX
======================================================
[b]Abilities[/b] Str 46, Dex 14, Con - , Int 14
[b]Skills[/b] Initiative +XX, Pilot +XX, Mechanics +XX, Perception +XX, Use Computer +XX
======================================================
[b]Crew[/b] 4; [b]Passengers[/b] 8
[b]Cargo[/b] 20 tons; [b]Consumables[/b] 1 month; [b]Carried Craft[/b] None
[b]Payload[/b] None
[b]Availability[/b] Military; [b]Cost[/b] 50,000 Credits

```

The ship also has 5 unspent EP.
Step 3
Now I calculate all the stats that are derived from the stats I just entered. All formulas should be in the SECR, assuming grapple uses the sane rules as on character scale (BaB + Str mod + Size mod), and a â€normalâ€ crew, the statblock now looks like this:

```

[b]Starship Name[/b]
Colossal Shuttle
[b]Init[/b] -3; [b]Senses Perception[/b] +5
======================================================
[b]Defenses[/b] Ref 14 (flat-footed 12), Fort 28; +12 Armor
[b]Hp[/b] 120; [b]DR[/b] 15; [b]Damage Threshold[/b] 78

```

Step 4
Now all the basic stats have been filled in, now I can start working with spending EP. I decide that this ship is going to be a passenger shuttle, but one that should be able to handle itself in a firefight as well. Not requiring to be able to sustain itself for any extended periods of time, I decides I can safely halve the consumables to gain an additional EP (-50% consumables gives +20% of stock EP = +1 EP). Also, seeing as it is supposed to ferry people, I can safely give up 15 tons of cargo space to gain 3 EP (Cost Modifier = 5, 3x5 = 15). Now the ship has 9 unspent EP. That seems enough.
Step 5
Now I decide what I want to spend the EP on. I obviously wants the ship to be hyperspace-capable, and since it has concumables for 15 days and the hyperspace jump can take max 6xHyperspace Class days, IÂ´m going to install a class 2 Hyperdrive just to be certain. How much consumables is really used in hyperspace is another matter, but IÂ´ll go by the book here. A Class 2 Hyperdrive costs 3 EP and 10,000 Credits. Seeing as it should be a veichle sent out only on specific errands, I only install a Limited Navicomputer with a 2-jump memory for 500 Credits. In order to have a chance in combat, I also decides to install Combat Thrusters, making the ship a much harder target for capital ships. Combat Thrusters costs 1 EP and 10,000 Credits. To defend itself against fighters, IÂ´ll also install a weapon system on the ship. In order to pack a punch, I choose a Heavy Laser Cannon, and also decides to Fire-Link 4 guns. This costs 4 EP and 24,000 Credits. I spend the last EP on installing a SR 25 shield generator, which also costs 7,500 Credits. The statblock now looks like this:

```

The ship is now complete, except for the name. You may have wanted to leave some EP left for someone to make their own modifications, but in this case I didnÂ´t.[/hide]

I appreciate the corrections and advice.
1) A poor mans regenerating shield. I could not find anywhere in the SotG which stated you could not add an additional shield as a back up.
2) Fixed, oversight.
3) Fixed
4) Fixed
5) Sacred Phoenix answered this one.
6) The attack bonuses from the Gozanti are off. I left the stats from the book because I thought I had missed something that gave the +8 bonus. I believe I fixed the them though.
As to the writing, it's not a strong point of mine.

Right, as I read it though, the second shield can become active when the other goes down.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-20 03:21:25)

Yeah, I thought about it as well, and having two generators would work fine. So the issue was really that it was unclear what you meant. "55+15" sounded like you had them stack.

> note they can&#39;t stack, and the higher one is the one that takes the damage, and you can only regenerate 1 shield at a time.

Aye, certainly, the damage would just be taken from the highest rated shield and getting the things up again would be a b*tch. Nonetheless, redundant/multiple systems it could make for an interesting variation in ship design philosophy that groups in Kalium could use.

The 8 layers of shielding is a good point as well. I have a suggestion to keep players from building ships with infinite shielding: Using the idea of railgun technology which would be able to penetrate standard shielding, you could have shields that have the capability of deflecting energy and solid ammunition, and can only be carried on colossal frigates or larger. That way, having ships that can use railguns but can't defend against them would force characters to find other ways to increase protection. Just an idea.

batteries are different from fire-links. batteries are actual weapons, while fire-links are extra weapons represented in increased damage.
hangar space is so messed up I don't even want to go thereMy attention is once again drifting back to stats - so regarding the hangar space - what should we do if we're wanting to put hangar space into a ship?

### **Thraken** (2008-10-31 19:25:34)

Greetings to thee. more questions have I :
First off, concussion missiles. Do you require a launcher of the same type i.e. light launcher for light missiles, medium launcher for medium etc. to use them?
What I'm getting at is do I need a Heavy Concussion missile launcher on a capital ship to launch the Heavy Concussion missiles, or can I use a smaller launcher for the job?
Any opinions on the use of unfirelinked weapons in batteries or singly? The idea I'm trying to do is the ability to slave weapons to a single controller (firelinking) but having the option for each to have a dedicated gunner if the crew is available.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-31 19:42:45)

yes, you need a specific launcher for each kind of concussion missile (can't fire heavy concussion missiles out of a light one)
now, I might allow you to fire smaller missiles (light in a medium launcher) but that's about it.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-31 23:46:44)

I suppose you could use the optional firelink rules, but youÂ´d loose out on a ton of damage.

---

### **Rebaav** (2008-11-01 10:12:56)

With Sagaization you aparantly can't have externally mounted missles or am I missing something. On a capital ship it makes sense, we see it all the time in modern navies. The Scimitar assault gunboat has had inumerable graphics showing a rack of missles (16) mounted on it's dorsal spine section. Now it's been relegated to a launcher right? The concept I've read was that they would drop their payload of heavy missles (vs anti-fighter missles) and go, and go they do. As an anti captial figther a salvo of 16 coordnated missles from a single fighter being directed at a capital ship is something to pay attention to especially if they were carrying heavy warheads designed for cracking capital ships. Now, not so much.
With torps vs missles today it's a question of medium. Torps go through water missles through air. With Star Wars it seemed Torps were high powered anti capital single or paired items launched from well launchers and missles were lower powered units released in volleys for effect and typically used against other fighters. Now not so much.
Can missle launchers release missles in salvos or are they strictly single fire? The idea & mechanic that shows a loss of damage from linking weapons seems very counter intuititive to me. Perhaps we could work on a house-rule for Kallium? If you have 2 weapons that each do 100 points average linked why would they not do something close to 200 or 150? or heck 125? A pair that each inflict 8d10x5 (for example) linked only provides 9d10x5 right? That's just doesn't seem right to me. 10d10x5 goes to 11d10x5? Oh come on now! I must have read that wrong. (I don't have ready access to the books mind you)
I think that, as a quick review will demonstrate, the people that frequent this site can do better.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-01 12:41:57)

Well, I suppose the fire-linking of weapons comes down to a tradeoff between accuracy of the weapons, and damage output.
With separate weapons, you may have to place a gunner at each weapon, but he can take his time to fire as good as he wants, thus inflicting more damage. While if you link them together, they will simply fire at the same time and in the same general direction, thus not being able to fire as accurate. However, it costs just some wiring and programming, nothing like building a new gun emplacement.

### **Rebaav** (2008-11-01 13:13:03)

> Well, I suppose the fire-linking of weapons comes down to a tradeoff between accuracy of the weapons, and damage output.

I suppose that's one way to look at it. It seems that it imbues the weapon to have someone using it, player or npc. Droid fighters don't seem to have that problem. In the description they delegate AI partitions for each weapon and each functions as if independantly operated.
The problem I have with that is the slaving of a weapon, which would function the same way. This seems to be what batteries are. Coordinated weapons. This would mean also that the Droid Tri fighter has a battery of 3 guns. Odd little omision that.
> With separate weapons, you may have to place a gunner at each weapon, but he can take his time to fire as good as he wants, thus inflicting more damage.

There are feats to do that right? Increasing damage. Burst fire and some other ones used on Heavy weapons.
> While if you link them together, they will simply fire at the same time and in the same general direction, thus not being able to fire as accurate.

I understand what you are saying. It suggests that only 1d of the 2nd weapon will get through to the target after the 1st weapon has taken it past the DR and the SR. Whether the DR is 5 or 50 or the SR is 5 or 50 or the 2nd weapon is 2d10x2 or 10d10x5. It's a simplification probably designed to keep things quick(very) and dirty(extremely). If a linked weapon is done in then there are still others working as the whole weapon array has not been comprimised. I like that and that seems to be the real (only really) benifit. Question is, is that good enough? Doesn't seem that way to me but that's just my opinion.
It seems to me, like the Droid fighter, that an array of linked weapons is a battery. The difference is that the linked array is only being controlled by one intelligence rather than multiple or a partition of one so it only fires at one target at a time. The systems to direct a starship weapon is different than, say, a mounted 50cal with another 50cal duct (or mesh : ) taped to it.
> However, it costs just some wiring and programming, nothing like building a new gun emplacement.

Or in the case of batteries none at all, just different command in the fire routine.
Droid fighters are sick.
The problem I see with linked weapons is magnified with missles. A fighter hit with one missle is one thing. A fighter hit with 2 or more is many very small things... :

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-01 13:31:46)

from what you're talking about, you've read Raul Torin's broken ship post correct?
I have no idea how raul got that many cannons on there, I think what he did was reduce systems that started at 0 by 50%. But yes, a droid starfighter can technically have batteries (the only kind of fighters that can by RAW)

---

### **Rebaav** (2008-11-01 14:16:41)

> from what you&#39;re talking about, you&#39;ve read Raul Torin&#39;s broken ship post correct?

Buh? I don't think so no. I tried searching for it, could you link it for me?
> But yes, a droid starfighter can technically have batteries (the only kind of fighters that can by RAW)

Given the description it seems that they are already, they just aren't directly identified as such, just described that way... evil. A small modification would be to remove the different weapon and add another of the same so now you've got 4 (Droid Quad fighter) then call the weapons the battery they are. A less involved mod (change nothing at all it seems) would be to call the 3 a Battery and leave it at that.
Mathematically I don't see that providing the benifit you'd expect though. Rolling 4 times for 4 guns shooting on their own at the same target vs 1 roll for 4 linked weapons and a slight damage increase if it hits at all (far less likely it seems) or a battery arrangement that provides bonuses (what are the particulars for that again?) on a single roll for the salvo. Could we work that out? Run that as a simulation? Full errata (if any) applied of course. Just like to see the actual benifit.
Lets have an average crewed ARC fight a Tri Fighter. ROLL IT UP! (please?)

If you look in the book under firelinking, it also says that firelinked turbolasers are often referred to as "batteries", but they point out that this is not the same as a battery in mechanical terms. My best example of firelinks is the X-Wing. TheyÂ´re four cannons, but they fire as one (I know there are variations, but still), but that doesnÂ´t mean they deal x4 damage, since not all shots will automatically hit.
What they **will** do, is to increase the probability of a shot actually connecting, since there are more bolts out there, and thus do more severe damage (CT damage, not HP damage).
Also. I wouldnÂ´t put too much into the ships in the books as following the rules go. Simply put it, they mostly donÂ´t.

Yes, that as well, but I was mainly going for that he can add say 3d10x2 for an additional light blaster cannon, rather than just making the existing one 4d10x2.

I understand what you are saying. It suggests that only 1d of the 2nd weapon will get through to the target after the 1st weapon has taken it past the DR and the SR. Whether the DR is 5 or 50 or the SR is 5 or 50 or the 2nd weapon is 2d10x2 or 10d10x5. It's a simplification probably designed to keep things quick(very) and dirty(extremely). If a linked weapon is done in then there are still others working as the whole weapon array has not been comprimised. I like that and that seems to be the real (only really) benifit. Question is, is that good enough? Doesn't seem that way to me but that's just my opinion
I think it can be good enough, depending on how it is used. My thinking is that firelinks are used separately mainly on starfighters. They need to save the space, and donÂ´t really need a super damage boost (since the ships they fight will mostly be weaker in comparison to what capital ships fight). Capital ships on the other hand should probably have a few "batteries" (firelinked) turbolasers (adds five dice) that they can fire either separately, or as a battery (in game terms).
Also, a single dice of damage can help to overcome SR or DR.
> It seems to me, like the Droid fighter, that an array of linked weapons is a battery. The difference is that the linked array is only being controlled by one intelligence rather than multiple or a partition of one so it only fires at one target at a time. The systems to direct a starship weapon is different than, say, a mounted 50cal with another 50cal duct (or mesh : ) taped to it

Or in the case of batteries none at all, just different command in the fire routine.
Droid fighters are sick.
The problem I see with linked weapons is magnified with missles. A fighter hit with one missle is one thing. A fighter hit with 2 or more is many very small things... :
Well, firing 2 linked torp launchers donÂ´t mean that both torps hit. But they probably forced the opposing pilot to exert (=HP loss) himself more to dodge them.

> Also. I wouldnÂ´t put too much into the ships in the books as following the rules go. Simply put it, they mostly donÂ´t.

O.o... well *that's* fun! Please note the lack of argument, I was suspecting it myself but I thought that was just because I need to read that book more (when I can get my hands on it).
> Capital ships on the other hand should probably have a few &quot;batteries&quot; (firelinked) turbolasers (adds five dice) that they can fire either separately, or as a battery (in game terms).

I'm going to have to get that section reviewed again. That reads just like the Tri-fighter. The difference on, say the x-wing, would be that the weapons could only fire at one target at a time together. Unless they were mounted differently and you have 2 controlled by the r2 unit... :
> Also, a single dice of damage can help to overcome SR or DR.

Sure and I understand that but you rapidly get to diminished returns especially with more powerful weapons when you'd think the opposite was true.
> Well, firing 2 linked torp launchers donÂ´t mean that both torps hit. But they probably forced the opposing pilot to exert (=HP loss) himself more to dodge them.

I don't much care for that explanation. I can see a pilot trying to avoid one while getting nailed by the other, something we've all seen in any # of different presentations. I see that as an increased chance to hit with one not increased damage as a result. If both hit I'd expect the target to behave as if both hit not just one slightly better.

Well I think thatÂ´s pretty subjective to how you feel things should be described. Say you fire a firelinked(2) proton torpedo launcher against an opponent. You hits with both torpedoes, but rolls really crappy damage rolls, and isnÂ´t enough to even beat the DT, but still, it takes some HP away. To me, thatÂ´d probably be something like seen in a movie where the pilot puts his ship into a spin to make two seeking torpedoes blast into each other right behind his ship. Say the damage was high enough to beat the DT, but not destory the ship. ThatÂ´d be the pilot dodging one missile, but getting struck by the other, suffering actual, physical damage to the ship. If it is enough to destroy the ship, that means a clear hit by both shots, or dodging one torp, but the other one striking your fuel cells or something.
People have been describing the "HP damage is not necessarialy physical damage" before, but I just wanted to share my opinions on why that explanation is sufficient for me. Also, SAGA has probably one of the clearest lines to determine when something results in actual physical damage: the Condition Track

Ah, ok so hitpoints on a ship don't refer to damage to a ship when depleted. That makes more sense. I apreciate the clarification.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-11-02 01:03:09)

I wanna throw some comments in because, ya know, I am soooo important and all that...
**Hyperspace**
Hyperspace travel. I am all about adjusting hyperspace engines. But, in order to have a galactic civilization, we need some kind of Fast-Than-Light method of travel. Its hard to wage war on an enemy that takes 50 years to get to. Thus, hyperspace. I propose a few ideas.
One is the hyperspace rings, or some other kind of warp gate technology. This is a very controlled method of travel, leading to taxes and what not for anyone going through a gate. Tracking one's destination would be possible, as well. Trade routes are predetermined, as one would have to send out sub-light ships out to the location for the exit warp gate, and that might take years if not decades or centuries. However, in the grand scheme of things, this would a a very cheap method. Everyone, even 'short ranged' vessels would be able to warp from one side of the galaxy to the next. With this idea, individual ships with hyperdrives would be rumored to exist, but no one have ever seen one...
The huge cost of hyperspace engines that are only economically viable on the largest of vessels (some one said this already...). A taxi service made of capital ships might exist. I'm sure others would have ideas on how this might be even more interesting. Using this idea, smaller vessels can have hyperdrives, but it would cost way, way too much for 99.9% of the population to afford...and why would the 0.1% bother? Luxury vessels, sure, but why would a super wealthy space traveler have a snub fighter done up for hyperspace travel?
Hyperspace used to be incredibly expensive, but recent technological advances have vastly increased the abilities. This is kinda like the above, but new hyperdrives are cheaper. Few, if any, have bothered to upgrade to the smaller hyperdrives because an increase in cost is still and increase in cost. This I think is the weakest of the three.
Personal favorite is the warp gate idea. But yawls milage may vary.
**Shields**
Shields...ah...shields. Huge, complex issue there. Do they protect against solid projectiles? If so, do they protect as well as they do against energy? If they don't, why bother with shields at all, since everyone would be using solid projectile weapons? Do they keep in air, or not? Do they keep in the living or not? Do they have holes, or not? Can a snub fighter fly "beneath" a capital ship shields? Do they protect against ion damage, or not?
Since we plan on having lots of different types of weapons (railguns to laser to blasters to plasma to sonic emitters...etc, etc) this become a quandary. If we make each and every damage dealing system a little different from each other, than we need to consider how each defense system fairs against them. I am in favor in tiny, if any, differences between each weapon system, and to have the defense systems work almost exactly the same to each. This keeps the modifications we do limited. But, I am willing to work with what anyone comes up with.
In short, we figure out how much work we want to do with the mmechanics, and we figure out what shields can and cannot protect against. Then we will know what kind of modifications we have can with ship armor and shields; i.e. each weapon system dealing different damage means we can have multiple systems, while a solids standard means staying with just shields and armor.
**Fire Linked and Battery Fire**'
In the context of of the Star Wars universe, both systems are designed to do the same thing get more fire on the target with each squeeze of the trigger. The rules have different purposes.
Battery fire is done as to increase the chances of hitting with *one* shot. Batteries spread the damage out over a wider area, increasing the chance you will hit something. I always think of the big turrets on battleships when I think of batteries. And as such, I don't picture fighters having them. I'm not ruling it out, I'm just not currently picturing it.
Fire Links put a lot of fire power in one little point. Because smaller ships have a better chance of hitting, fire linking is the way Star Wars uses to add each punch to that better than average chance of hitting. Again, a WWII eample is the fighter planes with their 4 to six heavy machine guns.
Rules changes adjustments...I haven't thought about it. I do that later...
**Missile Weapons**
Huge pet peeve of mine is how missile weapons are treated in Star Wars. Two kinds of anti-fighter missiles, and no anti-capital ship weapons. But, other than that, they are alright. So...yeah. Maybe more on this later, as well.

I liked the idea presented in Dune. A neutral party providing FLT transports. Perhaps Hyperspace tech was so involved that to have it you would have to invested EVERYTHING you had, thereby making it all you were about.
I liked this as an extention of this being a different galaxy. Hyperspace is different & The Force is different, or so I'd like to see. If the nature of the material of the galaxy is different then it would present it as a different galaxy rather than a cluster of the same (which to me is the feeling it has now, just a reload of the same thing).

In the D6 version of SW, from West End Games, Sheilds offered no protection from physical or ion weapons just lasers, the overwhelming majority of and most refined and easiest to obtain and impliment technology.
> In the context of of the Star Wars universe, both systems are designed to do the same thing get more fire on the target with each squeeze of the trigger. The rules have different purposes.

It was my understanding that battery refered to linked standalone weapons (each running it's own guidance and targetting systems) where fire-linked is multiple weapons but relying on a single fire control system. The difference is further presented when you knock out the fire control system. In the case of the Battery, only one weapon is unusable. In the case of a fire linked array, all weapons are non functional. Please do provide correction if this interpretation is incorrect.
I was watching the History channel and saw this fighter formation, it was like 5x5, a giant flying square. They would coordiante and pop off a burst all at once. That was one messed up bomber. I'd say that qualifies as a battery in terms of effect and it does show the example of multiple linked fire control systems (each fighter being one, take one out the rest are still there).
> Huge pet peeve of mine is how missile weapons are treated in Star Wars. Two kinds of anti-fighter missiles, and no anti-capital ship weapons. But, other than that, they are alright. So&#8230;yeah. Maybe more on this later, as well.

Not the only one there bub. I'd like to see fighters be able to carry a handful or less of x5 missles. This approach of the system not having fighters as any apreciable threat ... well we've all now seen the y-wings in CLone Wars inflict damage on a truly MASSIVE ship so I'm sure someone will come out with an errata... even if it has to be us!

### **Thraken** (2009-01-28 17:47:16)

Hello all, bit of a thread necro here but, was there a consensus reached regarding Kalium tech levels and ships?
I mean using only ship creation rules (with sensible house ruling or 'fixed' rules) and the issues regarding how prolific and advanced hyperdrive tech is in this galaxy and so on?

---

### **Rebaav** (2009-01-29 08:21:58)

I don't think any census was reached or a determination made near as I can tell. I think with what was presented in the Clone Wars Toon there are more things to consider than ever. I'd like to see some materials from there presented and discussed re scale and the effectiveness of fighters etc.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-01-29 09:42:10)

I'm afraid I don't know what you mean - are you referring to the new Clone Wars animation?
What is there that so drastically changes the nature of fighters in star wars?
Regarding the tech and ships, I was thinking roughly that 2EP drives are colossal, larger or hypersleds only. 3 EP drives are colossal (frigate) larger or hyper-ring only.
EU information seems a fair guesstimate as to maximum ship sizes. i.e. only the largest groups can even have a hope of building ISD level ships considering their price is said to be able to bankrupt many star systems. Thus probably only a few in this fragmented galaxy, with VSD level ships somewhat more common.

"Toon"= Animation in this case, yes. I'll try to recall some specific examples that are provided in the show but not in the game system that I've heard of.

* the Melevolence(sp?) could be crippled by a squad of bomb/fighters but the Republic ships of the line could only wear it down… slowly & barely.
* A Jedi Starfighter can strafe a bridge of a trade frigate and destroy it utterly.
* Previously mentioned Frigates get crippled by walker weapons (they were on the 'roid) which I'm to understand are not even a x2 weapon.

Has this been pursued/officiated further? I like this idea but is this how Kallium will be?

Well. There goes my perception of this new animation being less ridiculous and more serious.
That sounds like Trench Run-Star Destroyer syndrome, but overblown in proportions. The issue of starfighters on cap ships in SWSE has always been there. Not sure about how to fix the concussion missiles and proton torps. On the other hand, all the EU books have been fairly consistent in terms of attacking capital ships. I believe on one occasion hundreds of torpedoes were fired at an ISD by a small rag tag fleet filled with torpedoes and launchers.
I believe in a rogue squadron game or something, fighters can take out shield and power generators before shooting the bridge to take out star destroyers - so eh, you know -_-
Aye, the heavier walker weapons are x2 at most - although apparently Republic artillery walkers can carry turbolasers. But still. Overdramatic power levels -_-
> Has this been pursued/officiated further? I like this idea but is this how Kallium will be?

Not really, there was just some chatter in this thread about Hyperdrives possibly being less advanced or rarer, thus that was just my guesstimate

For moar hyperdrive strangleholds I'm proposing that all hyperdrives are nonstandard modifications for Garguantuan and smaller ships.
3EP drives are mostly if not all Military grade
x3 drive is restricted and the other 2EP drives licensed.
And if we really are doing hypergates I suppose it's a really small hyper modifier -_-

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-15 19:12:47)

Hmm, the discussion was long and I don´t think we got anything really concluded. There were mostly ideas batted around on how to change the rules somewhat. We´ve discussed various types of alternatives to hyperdrives, and a lot of other things.
What I do recall was in the beginning of the discussion is that all ships has to be created using the SotG rules, no exceptions. Of course new weapons, systems, etc that we come up with may be included as well.
I haven´t had the time to do it, but I´m going to repost a guide I made about how to create a starship, and also a preferred formatted stat sheet for people to use. Once I get some free time again, I´ll try to launch some sort of collective poll on the various alternatives for hyperdrives we´ve discussed, since that seemed to be the only place where the discussion got somewhere.
If you want to start creating ships go ahead, but be prepared that you might have to change them a bit, depending on if we decide about hyperdrives etc. And please be clear about the design process, so I don´t have to spam you with PM'ed questions <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Okay. One of the reasons I ask, is in the Faction Submission template, MoDa walkes about "Hypergate access." So I wasn't sure if this had been decided.
But apparently it was one of the options that was discussed, and he ran with it without a final YES.
