# Starship Designing Rules

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-16 16:55:16)

This is the rules for creation of new starships for the Kalium Galaxy

* All new ships must be created using the rules in *Starships of the Galaxy*, including any official errata and clarifications, as well as the following changes. Once I get my guide with the example sheet up, I´d appreciate it if people used that sheet, to get a uniform outlook.
* Hyperdrives is always considered nonstandard modifications unless the designer has the Starship designer feat. In addition, all hyperdrives have their EP costs increased by 5, and their Base Credit costs multiplied by 10. This is to represent the fact that hyperdrives in Kalium are not very developed or common.
* As hyperdrives aren´t very developed, navicomputers is neither. All navicomputers have their base credit costs multiplied by 5.

Use the thread below to discusss the existing rules and suggest new ones. Unless something specificially relates to the process of designing starships, please discuss it in another thread.

OK, so I just posted a few suggestions on how to implement the things that have been discussed. These are just suggestions, so feel free to thrash me for them <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
As we decide on new rules for designing starships in Kalium, or decides to change some rules, I´ll update and modify the first post in this thread.

I'm not so sure about the navicomputer part. Even if hyperdrives aren't well developed, the galactic population does have *some* way to get around the galaxy. That requires some kind of navicomputer, doesn't it?

Yeah, I just figured that since hyperdrives isn´t every man´s thing, navicomputers would be pretty expensive and sophisticated computers used only by major manufacturers (such as military and transport services). Other people who have hyperdrives in their ships might go by using astromech droids, downloading data from some available service, etc...
And you can still get a navicomputer for a decent price (for a colossal ship, you can get one for 12,5k or 50k), it´s just the advanced ones that really rockets away in prices.
What does everyone else think?

I like them. Simple, and yet meet everything I wanted from them. Awesome.
And the nav-computer thing works for me. Makes sense.
So...very cool

### **Thraken** (2009-10-17 08:54:58)

I might be wrong but... don't navicomputers allow untrained astrogation checks? sounds pretty awesome for a place where hyperdrive isn't so common.
And as you say there may be astromechs, navigation services etc.
Thumbs up - can we get moving on this yet? <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I like this and it introduces something I hadn't considered before.
<!-- s:r2: -->:<!-- s:r2: -->
It makes astromech units/services far more <strong>valuable</strong> than in GFFA... that's kinda cool! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

More efforts to close to gaps.
What happens to the **Starfighters** section of Hyperdrives in SotG? that is - the hypersleds and rings?
Remain the same?
Bump up to colossal only?
Removed entirely?
Also what changes if any should we make to the Hyperdrive/FTL derivative technologies like Hypertransceivers and Holonet Transceivers?

I see these as related so I'll respond to both.
It suggests, to me, that the same reasons why they'd go bigger, whatever it is, would also make them too big for sleds. At least the sleds shown in the movies/series as they'd have to be MUCH bigger.
HRings however would be different. With HRings it would make HoloComs delegated to them I'd think. Perhaps a huge ship with an FTL a little bigger than even it needs could use it to power a HyperComs but perhaps little else could be used on the ship? Diverting power etc?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-22 07:03:09)

I just realized something.
Would you all agree that when designing a ship, we can assume that the designer has Starship Designer? And that the only time you really have to worry about not having it is when you try to modify (not scratch-design) a ship.
On that same subject, what about Tech Specialist/Superior Tech?
My take would be yes on the first, but no on the second.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-22 09:47:29)

Conditional imo. If it's a faction that has a shipyard or a starship designer sure. If it's some pirates in an asteroid base somewhere slapping together a ship to shoot people with no.
And I don't think Tech specialist should be allowed in production vehicles. After all Tech specialist effects are specifically applied once only, meaning once out in the market they couldn't then tech specialist that.
Also - what's ur opinion on my previous post dammit?!

I hadn´t seen that particular detail before. Can´t say I understand why he would give such an answer, when the easy answer to the question would be "Yes, since reducing something by 50% gives 20% of the stock EP, and 20% of 5 is 1, you can".
I can´t say I like it though, but since it is official, perhaps people want to use it. Thoughts?

### **Thraken** (2009-10-27 10:47:46)

Having trawled and read through the Author's posts he just seems to do his math 'from a certain point of view'.
Since it's his official clarification I'm thinking just go with it unless everyone wants to house rule.
Also - any opinion on the holonet transceivers and hypertransceivers or am I gonna have to randomly prospose something like x5 the prices? <!-- s:evil: -->![:icon_evil:](https://i.ibb.co/C5wQfzF6/icon-evil.gif)<!-- s:evil: -->
P.S. Some players on the wizards forums do even more stupid things like -50% of 0 passengers for fighters :O

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-27 19:05:51)

Basically, since he only half specified it, you can actually get the same amount of EP for halving cargo from the Light Fighter stock ship as for the other smaller ship. After all, 2x10% of 2 == 2x10% of 5, when rounded up.
And on the hypertranceiver/holonet tranceivers, I would actually suggest removing them entirely. I think it could be a nice twist on things, and also a representation on how undeveloped hyperspace-related technology really is.

O.o what rounding math is this? Since when is "0.4 rounded up"==1? <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->

I was suggesting moving them to the Hyper Ring Network and to possibly enormous prototype hypersleds/transports.
Oh, that's found in the "'Other' ship systems" thread.

Well, if you round up to the closest integer...what do you say I get?

Depends on how you define closest. If it's any value over zero then 1. If the threshold involves a measure of significance it would have to be above 0.5 or 0.55 or whatever #. If the rounding threshold defined for Saga by Wizards is 0.4 then so be it. I thought rounding was 1/2+, so 0.5 or more. Lerniq is phun!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-28 05:41:45)

Well I define closest as being...you know, closest <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> Like 1 is the closest non-negative integer to 0.
What I meant was just that he said "round up", to me meaning that you always round the decimal number up to the closest integer.

Whut?
We're not even sure we have a true gate network given the discussion earlier that it be an uncommon thing.
And what do you mean by enormous hypersleds/transports? Colossal (Cruiser) only?
The way he counts it in his clarification it reads as reducing a system from base by 25% twice.
so 10% rounded up is 1, do it again totals 2.

I was refering to the "if you have a valuet of 0.4 is that closer to zero or 1" depends on if you are accepting the value of something greater that zero. If that's the case then 1 is greater than zero but then so is 0.000000000000000000000001. Depends on what you're trying to do. Details to follow.
I don't know the #s involved I was just looking at this:
> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**

2x0.1=0.2, 0.2x2=0.4.
5x0.1=0.5, 0.5x2=1.
0.4/=1
0.4 is "closer" to zero than it is to 1 but if it's an "anything greater than zero is rounded up to 1" situation then, sure, round up.

I understand. I'll try to break it down to if/then/else:
IF there are HyperRings THEN HyperComms would, I'd think, be part of that network ELSE the only way of using HyperComms would be with the only place where the sources of Hypers would be:HyperDrives which are found on, I'm to understand, larger ships.

I'm not clear on that. I'm to understand that point is still being fleshed out elswhere in the forum. I seem to recall the idea of starfighters having them is out, I'd have to find that.

I don´t want to get into a discussion over basic arithmetics, but look at the answer given in Thraken´s errata thread, and you´ll probably understand what I mean.

I'll look for that, sure.
