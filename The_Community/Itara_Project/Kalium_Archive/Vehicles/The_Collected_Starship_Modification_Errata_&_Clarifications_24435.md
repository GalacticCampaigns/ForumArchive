# The Collected Starship Modification Errata & Clarifications

### **Thraken** (2009-10-15 10:46:36)

As we we've more or less agreed on using the SotG rules - likely due to it being the only widely known standard of making ships in Saga edition I've collected the fragments of errata together to be used with the SotG and the S&V starship modification rules.
[**Wizards Errata Page**](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/SotGerrata1 "http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/SotGerrata1")
> **p. 47 – Table 3-5: Weapon Systems**
> The footnote in the table should read: “1 Colossal (frigate) or larger starships only”.
> **p. 47 – Table 3-7: Starship Accessories**
> Extended range should have an EP cost of 1.
> **p. 52 – Table 3-8: Stock Ship Types**
> The Strength scores for the following stock ships should be changed as noted:
> Battlecruiser: 100
> Cruiser: 94
> Frigate: 60
> Corvette: 58
> Heavy Freighter: 56

So here, establishing that turbolasers and other such heavy weapons are capital ship weapons only, extended ranges is a little more manageable and STR scores are corrected.

> **Q: I’ve run into some issues with the starship design rules in Starships of the Galaxy. It seems that you can’t make any existing starships using these rules and starting with a stock starship. Am I doing something wrong?**
> <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>
>
> A: Probably not. A vast number of individual starships have been created over the last few decades since A New Hope came out, and at no point was there a cohesive starship design system to guide authors of fiction or gaming products. As such, it is effectively impossible to reverse-engineer a design system that covers all these varied examples—or, at least, any such system would be so complex that it wouldn’t be easy to use in a game.
> Given that, we designed the system from the point of the typical hero who might be interested in modifying an existing starship or scratch-building a new one. This hero doesn’t have the benefit of vast numbers of the best engineers and test pilots in the galaxy (like at the Corellian Engineering Corporation), nor does this hero have an entire star system dedicated to the building of city-sized starships with mass-production facilities to match (like at Kuat Drive Yards).
> This hero, instead, is relegated to building “a typical new starship from a typical production facility,” as noted at the bottom of Table 3–8: Stock Ship Types (page 52, Starships of the Galaxy). The stock starships are designed to reflect that, making it possible to make something decent and functional, but not something that would easily outshine the big name starships.
> For example, a hero could build a decent light freighter, something comparable to a YT-1300 in stats and price. The biggest difference? The YT-1300 would have a lot of extra emplacement points left over—and that’s precisely what the Corellian Engineering Corporation is known for. Think about it: If any yahoo on a backwater planet could build a freighter that’s just as good, why would the YT-series freighters sell so well throughout the galaxy?
> Since most heroes won’t ever control a galaxy-spanning corporate giant and be able to use these resources, it seems a little silly to spend page space exploring the ins and outs of galactic-scale mass production. Similarly, we might give broad outlines of supply and demand by listing a planet’s major exports and imports, but we won’t be creating rules that account for macroeconomic cycles, unemployment, inflation, and so forth. (Let’s face it: Most of us are just here to shoot stormtroopers.)
> Now, if you as the GM want to build starships beyond what the stock starships can manage, there’s really not a reason for you to hamstring yourself with those rules: Just write up stats that seem like a good challenge for your players, using similar starships as benchmarks for things like price, appropriate game statistics for that type of ship, and so forth.
> And if you and your players really want more comprehensive rules that go beyond those in the book, by all means do so! You might look at Gear Templates (page 76, Knights of the Old Republic Sourcebook) to get some inspiration for coming up with appropriate special benefits and restrictions for different manufacturers. Alternatively, you might allow manufacturers to come up with “proprietary” stock starships that are better than the typical ones listed in the book. For example, Kuat Drive Yards might have a really good “stock Star Destroyer” and Corellian Engineering Corporation might have an outstanding “stock YT-series,” and they use these as the baseline for producing several similar starship designs.

>
> Q: **When building a new design from a stock starship, can you remove or replace existing systems that come with the stock ship? For example, could I take those high-performance engines off a stock interceptor and use the cash to buy other systems?**
> A: You can, but it’s not very efficient. You get only 1/4 the listed value of any system you remove from a starship, even a stock starship.
> Stock starships usually get their starting systems at a substantial discount because they are so well integrated into the baseline design. Removing them requires a lot of inefficient workarounds, resulting in a lower price comparable to selling a used starship component.
> **Q: Can you gain emplacement points by converting the cargo space provided by a cargo pod?**
> A: No. A starship can only convert its own internal cargo space into emplacement points.
> **Q: Do nonflying carried vehicles require hangar space? If so, it seems like the Imperial-class Star Destroyer uses more hangar space for AT-ATs and AT-STs than it does for TIE fighters and shuttles.**
> A: Hangar space is required only for vehicles that are meant to launch directly from the starship, such as airspeeders, starfighters, and space transports. If the vehicle is meant to be kept in storage until deployed planetside—as in the case of AT-ATs and the like—then the vehicle can be carried as cargo. The real difference is that a hangar-deployed vehicle is ready to fight when launched, but a vehicle carried as cargo needs a little help to become combat ready (usually about 1 minute of continuous work, assuming the vehicle’s entire crew assists).
> Vehicles stored in this way are still quite bulky (meaning they take up more cargo space than their mass would otherwise suggest). Nevertheless, this is considerably more efficient than allocating hangar space for the vehicle, which includes enough room for maintenance, repair, takeoff, landing, and maneuvering. The precise amount of cargo space required is ultimately up to the GM, but a good baseline is that a vehicle requires about 100 tons of cargo space—roughly 50 cubic meters—for every unit of hangar space it would normally require. (As a comparison, this is about 1/4 as much room as the same vehicle would require if you converted that cargo space into a hangar bay.)
> **Q: My players have discovered that they can make very good warships by modifying freighters, turning all that extra cargo space into emplacement points. I can’t find anything wrong with it in the rules, but it looks like a converted freighter could overpower a Star Destroyer! Am I missing something, or is this intentional?**
> <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>
>
> A: You are missing something. Under Nonstandard Modifications (page 39, Starships of the Galaxy), you’ll find this little catch-all rule: “The GM is the final arbiter of what systems are sufficiently dissimilar to qualify as nonstandard, and particularly unusual combinations may be forbidden altogether.”
> In other words, no modification is legal unless you specifically say it is.
> What you’re describing—turning a freighter into a big pile of emplacement points to hold high-end capital-ship weaponry—skids right past nonstandard (“sufficiently dissimilar” systems) and smacks right into the middle of forbidden (“particularly unusual combinations”). The rules as written not only empower you to veto such an absurd design, they expect you to do so.
> If your players object, tell them that they have to prove that the proposed modification is not “particularly unusual” by providing a few examples of similar cases. If they can’t find any such example ... well, “unique” is pretty unusual, isn’t it? We’ve certainly seen freighters with extensive modifications (Millennium Falcon, Outrider, Wild Karrde, Ebon Hawk), but none have had anything remotely approaching what you describe. In fact, the Gallofree GR-75 medium transport is specifically described as being frequently modified for many different functions, but the idea of turning it into a “pocket battleship” never seems to have crossed the Rebels’ minds.
> You can use the following guidelines to help you adjudicate these sorts of unusual cases, but keep in mind that guidelines are just that: guidelines. They aren’t hard-and-fast limits, and they aren’t substitutes for good GM judgment and common sense. Very generally speaking, if any of the following are true, the modification is probably nonstandard. If two or more are true, the modification is probably not possible at all (unless there are counterexamples that show otherwise, of course).
> * The starship does not have any similar system in its stock version, or if the system is specifically described as nonstandard for that type of starship (such as a hyperdrive on a starfighter).
> * The modification would increase the starship’s speed, hit points, or shield rating by more than 50% or the number of weapons, passengers, or carried vehicles (measured in hangar space) by more than 100% compared to the starship’s stock version.
> * If the starship has gained emplacement points equal to or greater than its cost modifier by converting cargo space, all further modifications are nonstandard except for volume-heavy modifications such as cryogenic chambers, escape pods, extended range, hangar bays, medical suites, passenger conversion, and smuggler’s compartments.

**Clarifications from WotC_Rodney - RPG Designer and recorded by RavingDork - organiser of the compilation threads**
> **Q: When making a starship from scratch using the stock models found on page 53 of the SotG book, is it even possible to get extra emplacement points by reducing a ship&#39;s starting values when it has less than 10 starting emplacement points to begin with?**
> A: Yes. In this instance, you round up and simply follow the order of operations. If you worsen a stock ship&#39;s starting value in an area by 50%, you gain EP equal to 2 x 10% of the stock emplacement points. For a ship that starts with 5 EP, you start with 7 EP (10% of 5 is .5, rounded up to 1, x 2 is +2, for a total of 7) instead. You can, of course, use the rules under &quot;Gaining Emplacement Points&quot; on page 38 to get more, as well.
> **Q: I know I can take cargo space and convert it into extra EP, and I know I can take EP gleaned from the methods shown on table 3-9 of the Starships of the Galaxy rulebook and convert them back into cargo space, but can I convert ANY extra EP I have (regardless of its source) and convert it into cargo?**
> <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>
>
> A: Yes you can. The footnote says, “Any emplacement points gained in this way may be kept as spares or used to purchase additional cargo space, adding tons of cargo capacity equal to the starship’s cost modifier for each emplacement point spent.”
> The “in this way” part does not explicitly state what “this way” is. Is “this way” the changing of stats on a stock ship? Or is "this way" more specific, referring only to increasing your crew requirements, which is what the previous sentence was talking about? Or is “this way” more general, referring to any change that gives you extra EPs?
> It’s the last one. The phrasing that I had in my turnover was this: “Any leftover emplacement points may be kept as spares …” It didn’t specify that it applied that particular method at all, and -- as I mentioned -- it wasn’t meant to. I’d meant to point this out elsewhere in the chapter, and that part of the footnote was supposed to be a reminder of how you can add extra cargo by spending EPs because this was one time you'd be particularly likely to want to do so.
> During his final pass while getting it ready for typesetting, the managing editor rephrased it become he didn’t like using “leftover” as an adjective, but he wasn't trying to change the rule. Unfortunately, his phrasing compounded my error because it could very easily be read to mean it applies only to stock ships.
> In the absence of evidence to the contrary, you’d be right to read it conservatively and assume that it only applies to stock ships because of where it appears in the chapter. But, now that I have pointed out how it is meant to be read, you do have evidence to the contrary.
>
> </details>

Yeah. Short version - you can interchange internal cargo space and EPs.
> **Q: I can adjust a ship&#39;s Strength, speed and other base traits down 25 or 50% to gain more emplacement points, right?**
> A: Wrong. The emplacement points text on page 53 is referring exclusively to the values on Table 3-9. You cannot lower any of the base stats found in table 3-8 on the previous page in the manner described. Notice the text specifically refers to &quot;values.&quot; Table 3-9 is specifically labeled &quot;Stock Ship Base Values&quot; whereas Table 3-8 is not for this very reason.

I have to admit. It says this in the book but I missed this :/
> **Gravity Well Projectors**
> There are discrepancies in the book about whether gravity well projectors produce a 3x3 square area or a 4x4 square area. As the diagram shows, it should be a 3x3 area. [SOURCE]
> **Medical Suite/Passenger Quarters (Errata)**
> The Medical Suite and Passenger Quarters upgrades mention that every time you get it, your ship gains enough to accommodate a number of patients/passengers equal to your ship&#39;s size modifier. It should read &quot;ship&#39;s cost modifier&quot; as most larger ships have a negative size modifier.
> As a rule of thumb, starfighter and shuttle passenger space is considered to be seating.
> **Unique Starship Crews (Clarification)**
> You determine the following vehicle stats in the following ways (in order of stat block appearance):
> Vehicle Initiative: The pilot&#39;s Initiative modifier (or the Pilot skill modifier if you are trained) + vehicle&#39;s size modifier + vehicle&#39;s Dexterity modifier.
> Perception: Character&#39;s normal Perception modifier.
> Reflex Defense: The vehicle’s Reflex Defense is equal to 10 + size modifier + armor bonus (or pilot’s heroic level) + Dexterity bonus.
> Attack Rolls Gunner&#39;s base attack bonus + vehicle&#39;s Intelligence modifier + miscellaneous bonuses (point blank shot, weapon focus, etc.) + 2 (if trained in Pilot and firing pilot controlled weapons from the pilot&#39;s position).
> Base Attack Bonus: The gunner&#39;s base attack bonus.
> Grapple: A vehicle’s grapple modifier is equal to its pilot’s base attack bonus + the vehicle’s Strength modifier + the vehicle’s special size modifier (Large +5, Huge +10, Gargantuan +15, Colossal +20, Colossal [frigate] +25, Colossal [cruiser] +30, Colossal [station] +35).
> Skills: Character&#39;s appropriate skill modifiers ( + vehicle size modifier + vehicle Dexterity modifier in the case of the Initiative and Pilot skill). **If the ship&#39;s computer is friendly or helpful towards you, you also add the ship&#39;s Intelligence modifier as an equipment bonus to your Use Computer checks.**
> If it is not listed above, than it is not changed by having unique crew or is otherwise explicitly spelled out in the book.

I thought that was a rather interesting detail =_=
I've not trawled through the almost 200 pages of posts in the two threads and just read some of the collected summaries, so there may be more out there...

Now it's time for everyone to laugh at DarthAnthrax as he crunches on all this <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
generally they're fine and tighten up the modification rules well. It's been established once and for all that it was never meant for real production ships, but that's moot for our purposes in here.
edit: The person who wrote Jedi Counselling 115 has been chatting about starship rules and raises some interesting points.
One thing he proposes is a launch tube - which is more or less a hole you shove a ship out of rather than a hangar. Battlestar time anyone?

Awesome. I've always had trouble with starship building so having all the errata and everything in one place should help. Thanks!

Tis ok, as I briefly chatted with DarthAnthrax about, it may be hard to take on a system when not everyone knows the system or it's myriad extra bits scattered across the internet.
The following are things suggested by the writer of JC115 and one of the makers of the modification system I believe. But they are just forum posts, so ambiguous in officialty.
**Launch Bay (4 EP, Common, Colossal or larger, 5,000 credits base)**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A launch bay is designed to hold a specific class of vehicle. Unlike a hangar bay, a launch bay does not have facilities for maintenance, repair, or reloading the carried craft, but it does have a hatch for crew access and a small port that allows refueling. Also unlike a hangar bay, launch bays are designed to fit snugly around a single type of vehicle: An X-wing launch won't hold a Y-wing.
A single launch bay holds (starship's cost modifier)/5 units of launch space, and but multiple bays can be combined to create a launch for a larger vehicle if necessary. The launch space required to hold a vehicle is determined by its size, just as with hangar bays: Huge, 1 unit; Gargantuan, 5 units; Colossal, 20 units.
Being so exposed to the exterior of the starship, launch bays do not provide much protection to the vehicle carried inside. Any time the carrying starship is damaged, all vehicles in launches take damage equal to one-half the amount that exceeds the carrying starship’s damage threshold (if any), ignoring DR and SR.
As a comparison, a Colossal (frigate) starship could use 4 EP to hold 4 small lifeboats (Gargantuan size but very compact design), 2 X-wing launches (Gargantuan size and not compact), or 1 large lifeboat (Colossal size but very compact design).
This will work on a smaller ship, too, but it is a very major modification: On a Colossal starship, a Gargantuan launch would require 20 EP, but then an X-wing should fill most of a light freighter.

</details>

> Here&#39;s another good rule of thumb: If you want to do something usual with a system &ndash; make it concealed, make it hold something it wouldn&#39;t normally hold, make it modular (i.e. so you can swap out a weapon mount quickly instead of as a modifcation), or whatever &ndash; the simplest way to handle it is to charge 2 x EP and 5 x cost, similar to a nonstandard modification (but the Starship Designer feat won&#39;t bypass the extra cost). For example, a quad medium laser cannon costs 2 EP and 20,000 cr, and a retractable quad medium laser cannons would cost 4 EP and 100,000 cr.
> Off the top of my head: It would take a DC 25 Perception or Use Computer check to detect a concealed weapon from the outside. (I&#39;m using the Hardpoints modification from Scum &amp; Villainy for inspiration because I think it&#39;s more similar than a concealed hangar, which can be buried deep inside the hull.) Inside, its presence will be detected by a relatively thorough inspection (DC 15 Perception check, requires [starship cost modifier] minutes), much like a hidden cargo hold (Scum &amp; Villainy).
> Retracting or deploying a concealed weapon system requires its gunner to use a standard action, and during that time it can be detected by a DC 15 Perception or Use Computer check.

Thanks man, this was most helpful. I had read most of that already, but the stuff from the Wizards boards was good news.
Basically, I was planning to repost my old guide for creating starships with these rules (somewhat updated), along with a easy-to-use, easy-to-read stat sheet that people can use, to make things as simple as possible.

Makes sense. You just need to bring up an example of the ship you want use as inspiration for yours. Like bringing up the [*Krayt&#39;s Honor*](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Krayt%27s_Honor "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Krayt%27s_Honor") when you want build a transport that is armed. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: --> <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Just to be clear, I will never use a ship from the books as an example of how to create a ship using the starship creation rules. If you want to know why, just try to replicate such ships using the rules <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
And this we agreed on before, but I can repeat it. **Only original design ships (or modifications thereof) will be allowed in Kalium**. As in, you don´t take a ship from a book and modify it and then send it in. You either design a ship from scratch, or modifies a design someone else made from scratch.
