Shortly after the defeat of the Sith, a starship designer from Fothayne had completed her studies of the now mass produced Ysanna hyperdrive. She developed a hyperspace capable transport project in her spare time which his employers at Neogrounds Industrial had encouraged. In a move that shocked Neogrounds and the Ysanna she released the plans as open source in the name of affordable interstellar travel for all. What became of her after that is a popular subject of rumor, speculation and fiction. On the bright side, the vision came true and many smaller colonies could now procure a ship for moving people and goods. These vessels are prolific, having been manufactured for over a decade in workshops throughout the Galaxy. These ships are usually found in use close to those who built them as the lack of standardised construction means that construction quality may vary wildly. Given the option most choose to purchase a commercial craft. If not, buyer beware.
Ships of this class are seventy metre long wedge shaped blended-wing/lifting body craft. The design is meant for easy construction and so possesses generous space allowances for error. Typically this results in varying amounts of space and power surplus (GM may roll 1d4-1 to determine the remaining EPs of the ship). As these craft are often built by communities or groups who cannot afford to buy commercial ships, they often leave out the escape pods in order to maximise the precious revenue they can make on the ships. Only the uncommon examples built by those on developed worlds are likely to possess escape pods as appears on the plans.
This is probably Kalium's equivalent of an early YT series freighter. GMs are quite within their rights to make the ship used and/or unreliable for the hell of it <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
2 EP crew +50%
5EP stock

Anyway, I think you´ve been a little too generous with applying the rules for gaining extra EP. My understanding was that you were only allowed to apply the "worsen by 25/50 %" once per item, meaning that your crew/passengers thing isn´t really legal. And is there any reason (beyond just wanting more EP) to remove all Escape Pods?
Shouldn´t the hyperdrive by 5 EP only, since it has been designed by a professional designer?
Otherwise it looks like a nice ship, but perhaps you should equip it with some more "stock" equipment, like a shield generator and some weapons perhaps. Even though the YT-series is a very flexible design, they seems to put some stuff in from scratch.

Ah. really? That closes up the universe quite a lot... as it'd be almost impossible to get anything into the gaps between stock ships. I'll try and have a look on the wizard forums sometime.
Your rules I believe was +5EP so 6 EP normally. The story behind it is that it was 'open sourced' for easy building, so I was thinking double EP for it to be more reliable/easy to build by whoever. Going by this reasoning - it'd probably massively complicate things for these people to have to build a set of escape pods to go with the ship.
Again, this is to represent the cheapest possible craft in the galaxy - like small commuter/cargo planes connecting small rural settlements in the real world.
P.S. it's just a random quote, why would you suddenly bring in sparrow? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Doh, I forget the things I say <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> . You´re right, 6 EP it is. As for the double EP however, if a designer with SD has made the design, then it is only 6 EP and 1000 credits base. If not however, it becomes 12 EP, and 2000 credits base (nonstandard mod). So pick one. As for the escape pods, I can buy that, but it seems like they should be standard on ship, unless there is some specific purpose not.
I´m not trying to bash creative design, I just want to be strict on people following established rules, otherwise we´re looking at SotG-style mess bigtime.
Because I remembered him saying something like that, and because he is such an awsome character? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I like the idea very much, and it saves me from having to do a similar design to fill the same niche.
The reason escape pods aren't in the "Stock" design, is simply because if its being made by small shops all across the galaxy, not all the same parts are going to be available. So while one place might include the "Escape pod model Y" the next place would have to substitute "Escape Pod model Z"
Are they the best ships in the galaxy? No. There is just so gosh darn many of them.

yay!
/me glomps Ava
Aye, escape pods or other systems they'd probably buy in rather than make from scratch themselves. ^_^ (Unless they *really* want to)
I'd thought about doing generic heavy freighter or passenger liner, but at those scales there are just so many possible combinations...
(Still haven't looked for clarification on the rules yet. The reason I feel they should be applicable more than once is just for variety - in cargo space, passengers, consumables and crew. Some ships might be very short range and only have a few days worth. Some might be the bigger ships in that size class and so have more crew etc. etc.)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-22 12:34:59)

Yeah, I can understand the thinking behind it, but is there really enough variation in escape pod designs to warrant this? To me, obviously anyone building a larger ship would include escape pods, and as far as I am concerned, they would probably look quite the same, no matter what parts and stuff you get. Small craft, limited engines, life support and supplies for a few people... - so why not just use the standard escape pod rules? Unless you really really want to start produce multiple variants on escape pods, but I think it is a small enough detail that is handled well by the rules.
Besides, removing escape pods are illegal (unless we want to change that), so this can´t really be your basic "is everywhere" ship.
EDIT: While I´m a big fan of things generic, I would say that the stock ship models are as generic as they come. But I think it is better to keep it pretty abstract. For example, this ship could exist in a thousand variations, and yet they could all have the same stats.

### **Avarna** (2009-10-22 13:08:52)

Well, of course for the sake of simplicity all escape pods have the same stats. But that doesn't mean there aren't variations between manufacturers.

That´s what I meant, why not just let the pods be there, and then if an individual wants to remove them, then he does that, gets the EP, and makes his ship illegal. It seems the end result becomes the same.
@Thraken: While I haven´t actually found it printed anywhere about the reducing cargo and stuff, I do have a very simple argument against it. It may fall under common sense to prohibit it, but a character who decides that his ship doesn´t need say, cargo space at all, has an unlimited number of EPs. Start at 100 ton, then halve it, then halve it again, then again, then again...you see where I´m going don´t you?

### **Thraken** (2009-10-22 14:09:52)

I was working from base cost - so -50% = half. -50% = nothing.
Though I was in a conundrum as to how to handle crew.
In any case

Confirmed.
The universe crumbles and Thraken cries in his ronery little corner.

I finished reading the interior description before readin the exterior and couldn't help but start thinking of a Firefly-type transport. Any one else getting that?

Edited for the Iron Boot of Thrax rule compliance.
I've never seen Firefly or Serenity but that ship damn well does not look fuel efficient for something that can travel in planetary atmosphere :P
