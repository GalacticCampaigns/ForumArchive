# Cadan Atmospheric Fighter

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-27 22:51:13)

since the Cadans specialize in sonic weapons, their fighters are mostly effective in atmosphere (though they make fighters that are meant for space combat as well)
All sonic weapons on cadan ships use the templates (that I put in the weapons/armor forum)
This is a short range fighter, but does possess shields. It has a laser cannon for fighting in space, but operates best in atmosphere

I'm curious about the sonic weapon used on a fighter in atmosphere. I'm assuming that the fighters speed is less than supersonic otherwise the sonic weapons would have difficulty. If that's the case wouldn't this fighter be at a significant disadvantage?

you should never have a vehicle that moves faster than the bullets it fires lol

let's pretend that sonic technology has been improved so much it moves much faster :P

I was thinking on this. What if the sonic tech was integrated into the control surfaces of the vehicle (Ride the wave.) A fighter that controls the shocwave it rides using advanced sonic technology... perhaps enhancing it's shields in an atmosphere or perhaps only the particular atmosphere it's calibrated for. It makes for an intimidating mental image at least.

interesting idea, I like it

Also if it was calibrating the sonic boom to escalate it rather than diminish it this snubfighter could blast planetary surfaces to bedrock or create earthquakes on demand. Sonic resonance + butterfly effect = :
