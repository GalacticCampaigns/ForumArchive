# Space Combat

Space combat:
How do we want it in the Kalium Galaxy?  As anyone can tell from the Starships and Roles thread, I am in favor of making it look closer to World War II than it's current inception.  Things I propose:
Difference in technology
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

As I stated in the weapons thread, this galaxy never had the Republic or Empire to force everyone to use the same technology.  What better way that to show great divergence in the ships?  One organization has bio weaponry, another uses x-wing like fighters.  The Alican Ascendants have full sized capital ships, complete with shields and Herculean mass drivers, while the Visto corporation have *no* shield technology, but hollow out asteroids, and stick huge fusion cannons out every nook and cranny (be advised, they have no rear facing, and can shoot in every direction). 
Certain sized ships could be restricted due to species or organizations.  The duro, well known for their excellent fighters, never quite caught up with everyone else in the capital ship arms races.  The Scribed Confederacy could focus in on medium sized ships (ya know, Colossal) as their primary combat vehicles.  The Ganthet Theocracy, with their trillions of followers, have no problem filling up their city sized battle cruisers, choosing to man the ships with people while their fighters are all droid fighters.

Weapons
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Make three (maybe four) tiers of weapons: anti-fighter, -small ships (like transports), -anti-big ships (capital ships) (and perhaps anti-space station level weapons). 
Anti-fighter weapons would include both direct fire weapons (lasers, machine guns, rapid firing railguns, etc), and possibly small missiles (like how proton torpedoes are treated now days).
Anti-small ship weapons would include slightly bigger guns (like what was on the 'Falcon) as well as slower, but more powerful rockets and missiles (heavy torpedoes, maybe?).
Anti-big ship weapons would include turbo lasers and other super heavy cannons, as well as really heavy bombs and such.  I am looking more at battle ship, 12 inch guns than what turbo lasers are listed as.  Anti-big ship guns should be able to track fighters *at all*, and instead as strictly for slow moving craft (like other capital ships) or planet side targets.
I would suggest bring back facing, but that would require way too much work, I think.  Or is it?

</details>

Size Difference
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Maybe there is a the sizes when it comes to Damage Reduction.  If you are a fighter, shooting lasers at a Capital ship Cruiser, then the Cruiser gets +20 to it's DR.  The fighter's anti-ship bombs wouldn't have that issue, however.  On the plus side, the cruisers point defense weaponry wouldn't gain any bonus damage, but should the fighter hole still for about 12 seconds, then the cruisers big guns would gain +20 to damage.

</details>

Hyperspace
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

What species have independent access to hyper space vs who does would matter a great deal in this galaxy.  This is worth it's own thread.

Just ideas

Just as Breeder said, I think thereÂ´s no limit to how many different versions of ships and designs there could be. This can allow anyone to be as creative as they wants. I donÂ´t really think that **restricting** ship sizes is anything I would favor though. Sure, every organization will probably have something they do better than others (Empire vs Rebels is another good example), but saying that they **canÂ´t** build anything else just seems wrong to me.
A few different weapon types can probably be a good thing. IÂ´d say Point Defense, Standard, Capitol and Heavy Weaponry.
PD represents the smaller weapons installed on Capital Ships and Space stations to defend against fighters. A Capital Ship (a size category could be the limit here??) cannot fire anything else than PD weapons against Starfighters (another size category as line??), but can use any kind of weaponry against larger ships.
Standard means the typical class of weapons used on fighters and other non-capitol ships. They deal an average amount of damage to other ships of similar sizes, but lose som efficiency against Capitol Ships.
Capitol is the standard weaponry for Capitol ships, and cannot be targeted at starfighters, and perhaps suffers a penalty against ships of the "between fighters and capitol" class.
Heavy weaponry is just a little bit of everything that is not a conventional DF weapon: Missiles, bombs, rockets, buzz droids, tractor beams...It can be used against any class of ship, without penalties (thus bomb- and torpedoe-loaded fighters are still a threat to Capitol ships).
I like the idea of giving more DR for larger ships being attacked by smaller ones. I would suggest that perhaps this bonus should be relative to the size difference of the capitol ship and the non-capitol ship? That way, a larger ship (like the *Falcon*) will have slightly more to put up against an ISD than an X-Wing.

Before I forget: ship size in the Kalium Galaxy
In Lucas-verse, there was the Old Republic, the Empire, the New Republic, and so on.  Huge, massive organizations that had an entire galaxy's wealth to draw upon.  This meant truly massive ships, such as *Eclipse*-class Star Dreadnaughts and the [Death Star were actually plausible.  With 60 or more scattered governments in constant strife when not in all-out wars, I don't think this galaxy have nearly the same number of Star Destroyers and other huge capital ships.
But that's just a thought.  I dig ISD's.

well, I like more variety in ships, instead of just making a few giant ships, having many smaller ones that combined can do quite a few things

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-11 03:20:51)

It will be the same effect. In the LucasÂ´s galaxy, Captio ships were common enough that it took something like a SSD or the *Eclipse*-class to seem really impressive.
If we make the standard in this galaxy smaller ships, the ones that do are large (similar to ISDs) will be more impressive.

That gives me an idea.
What if we had an invading civilization that brought massive SSD size ships (well, maybe half a dozen, not THAT many).

I agree with the idea of diversity with ships and fleet structures. With a far more fractured/factionalized region the fleets should reflect the factions that support them: Varied. In EpIII the fleets and the factions involved seemed very evenly matched fleet wise. This implied a comparable power base & therefore comparably matched factions.
In Episode VI the fleets seemed very different in structure (am I seeing a medical frigate trying to broadside an ISD!?) and that was directly from & because of 2 very differing fleets from 2 very differing organizations with one acting out of desperation (example above). Rebellion/Resistors vs Empire/TheMan.
This brings up a related observation. Ship representation in Episode VI vs Episode III vs Clone wars.
In EP VI ISDs seemed Massive compared to the equivalent ships of the line that exchanged broadsides in EPIII yet I understand that they are comparable stat wise. This seemed odd and I dismissed it as a difference between the 2 eras of special effects...
Then came Clone Wars.
I've seen a jedi fighter strafe and slag a bridge and walker weapons inflicting major harm to what seemed to be frigates. Ywings cripple something that several ships of the line could not break threshold on. I'm sure there are other examples but I hope you guys see where I'm going with this.
Perhaps we need to address just what *is* SW weapon scaling?
