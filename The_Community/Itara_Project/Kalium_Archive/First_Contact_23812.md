# First Contact

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 22:22:54)

While I was thinking about Modavadar's timeline, a story idea popped in my head. So, what might have happened:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">First Contact</span>
*History is a story, thus dependent on how we tell it…*
“Sir? Colonel Renth?” Stella dropped her face into her hands at the sound of her name. The storm that had been building the back of her mind for weeks increased, pressing against the inside of her temples. *By the Gods, I hate my name,* she thought glumly.  *The only time I hear now is when something went wrong.* She sighed and waved a hand at the voice, not bothering to look up.
“What is it, ensign?” She could actually heard the junior officer gulp. She could smell the fear on him- on the whole command crew- which furthered her annoyance. Yes, she had a reputation for shooting the messenger, but that was figuratively, not literally.  *It was better to be feared than not,* she thought, *isn’t that what they say?* In either case, she was getting that olfactory implant removed when they got back.
“Uh, sir, the, uh, the FTL showing another quantum spike,” the ensign answered. “It, uh, looks like the same one as yesterday.”
Stella looked up at him, and the stink of fear doubled in strength, and the ensign quickly turned away, retreating back to his work station. No longer amused by the spectacle, she glared around the bridge, considering her options. Heads snapped back to their stations, and more than a few hunched their shoulders as her gaze crossed over them.
The bridge of the *November 11* was small, as far as a capital ship was concerned, yet still held plenty of room to move. Her chair was centered and pulled back beyond the halfway mark, giving her a good view of the main screen as well as most of the stations on the bridge. Each section contained several stations, and commanded by a captain. On a less important ship, a lieutenant would head each section, but Colonel Stella Renth had no lieutenants. *The first test of the military FTL was not going to be crewed by newbie LT’s,* or so the Admiral said.
Stella would trade all the captains on-board for one lieutenant if that lieutenant knew what was wrong with the FTL.
“Sir?” the voice came from behind her, where the FTL stations were. She would have preferred the FTL controls to be where she could see them, but they took up too much space. Sensors, Navigation, and Weapons were too important during high pressure situations to be removed from her immediate sight. She would have to deal with the annoyance of turning her head.
*I hate FTL,* she glowered at the deck, deliberately ignoring the nervous call from behind her. Under the polished metal flooring was where the newest baby of the fleet was nestled. The new FTL engine could propel a space craft at an amazing speed of over 10 times the speed of light. But it took days for the FTL computer to put approve a jump. Over twenty-five people on the *November 11* were required to monitor the FTL, tweaking and adjusting at every turn, cajoling the engine into performing as it should. But it took days to calibrate, during which the ship had to stay clear of planetary bodies, asteroid fields, and anything else remotely interesting- including, she had discovered, where some gravity producing mass had passed in recent history- and float perfectly still in space. For *days*. Until the computer stated it could not reach an acceptable success percentage for the jump.
This was the twelfth attempt to return on from their maiden jump. The twelfth attempt, and eighty-sixth day.

“Sir?” the voice repeated. She recognized the speaker as Gregory Kolendor, and scowled into her palm. He had gone from an over stepping blow hard into a nervous puddle with one of Stella’s verbal barrage. She couldn’t stand either end of the spectrum.
“It had better be good news,” she said. Kolendor actually fell silent. A foot shuffled behind her, a throat cleared, and the fear smell lessened. The foot shuffled again before its owner spoke up again. She waited for the man to finish steeling himself. *Really,* she mused angrily, *when did everyone lose their spine when talking to me?*
“Sir, ah…the…uh, the astrogation computer…this is the same spike as last time-“
“Ensign Barrack already *said* that,” she snapped, and the fear stink flooded in once more. Gregory Kolendor, a civilian- she almost spat- scientist in charge of babying the FTL. He had entered the ship with a chip on his shoulder, fully intending to buck up to the Colonel, no matter her reputation. His attitude had changed quickly enough.
“Uh, yes ma’am,” he replied, and his voice actually broke as he caught his mistake. “Uh, sir. Yes, sir.” By regulation, a civilian could address her by her gender. But she was Colonel Stella Renth , by the Gods, and on her ship, she would be addressed as such. That point had been made clear before the jump that got the *November 11* out in the middle of nowhere.
She heard his footsteps shuffle away. The shuffling stopped, scuffed, and shifted again. She heard him turn around and smelled his backbone stiffening. “Uh, ma’am- sir! Sir, this is, ah- I suggest we move again, another lighthour. It appears…uh, I think we are in still in the trace of the gravity body.”
“Frakking wonderful,” she cursed. *Still in the ancient path of something that left a ripple in the galaxy like a boat leaves a wake through a pond,* she thought. It was intolerable. The astrogation computer had been detecting this wake for the last month. *What did the gods send this way? How long ago? A comet? Meteor? Rogue planet?* Stella knew the large the gravity mass, the greater the wake and the longer it would- *should* affect the FTL. But even something as small as her own vessel would interfere with the calculations, provided it pass by recently.
“I think,” Kolendor continued, bringing his voice back under control, “that it would be prudent…” his voice trailed off as she turned her head to meet his eye. The scientist dropped his gaze almost instantly. “The…uh, the move. A lighthour. At- at… at least a lighthour.” Kolendor turned away after that, and busied himself with the FTL stations.
Stella sighed, and stared back at her palm. It was tempting, she admitted to herself. Simply move before the astrogation computer was finished its calculations. After all, it was nearly a 100% certainty that the computer would once more recent their position as out of tolerance. Why not take steps to speed up the process? Cut a few corners, and maybe get home that much quicker? After all, her husband and children were waiting for her. Shouldn’t she think of them? What would they wish for?
“No,” she said aloud, and the whole bridge flinched. Was her voice really so offending? “No, we do this the right way, by the book. We wait until the computer is sure this is a bad spot and then- *only* then- do we move again.” The crew went to their stations, and the scientists went back to theirs. She knew some weak hopes were crushed, but she noted most of the crew relaxed and began to whisper from station to station. Her crew knew her, and her answer was expected. *Let them take heart in that,* she decided.

Eight hours later, she was still in the command chair, watching the readout for the FTL computer process data once more. The feeling of a storm hadn’t let up. The feeling had been slowly building since she was given this mission. It wasn’t like when she hunted pirates and raiders, back in her home system. She would get a similar feeling then, hours before the actual skirmish. No matter if they found their quarry, or if her ship was ambushed, she had always known a battle was coming. This building storm was similar, yet…perhaps it was *that* battle, the one she wouldn’t return from.
But it didn’t make any sense. They- everyone aboard the November 11- were deep in empty space, far from their home system, and the factious colonies there. No one else had a stable FTL system. The colonies had their share of ships- she had sparred with enough colony fleets to know- but only her planet- the Prime, birth place of the species- had made any effort in leaving the system. Their spies had told them that much.
*Then again,* she mused, *the first FTL ship out of the system has a full complement of missiles, and plenty of heavy rails.* It didn’t seem strange, when she had first been told she was piloting the first FTL ship. This was a military ship, and required armament. But…even she thought they were over doing it. *We even have two nukes. Who are were going to fight out here?*
The FTL data continued to stream across her screen. She didn’t understand it, and only started watching it two months ago out of boredom. Massive amounts of sensor readings were taken over and over again, addressed by dozens of different programs, compared against each other and against previous sensor readings, all scrolling by faster than she could follow. She idly wondered if she should get an upgrade synaptic processor, so she could read all of this. She discarded the idea almost as quickly as she thought it. *I want to read this like I want a peg leg,* she decided.
Then her eye caught something. At first, she didn’t know what, but slowly, she recognized the pattern of the sensors had changed. Two months of the same data streaming in front of her and she had noticed a change, even if she didn’t understand it. Stella thought about briefly paging back until she found the change, but didn’t. She only knew what pages of data streaming by looked like, not what a particular page said. Instead, she glanced back to the FTL section.
Kolender’s nightshift counterpart, one Debra Tolf, was there, idly playing some card game on one of the stations to pass the time while the computer conducted its scans. She looked back toward the sensor section. Ensign Barrack was no longer at his station, his shift having expired four hours ago. Her own replacement, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Blake, was snoring softly in the pilot’s chair at the head of navigation. Stella hadn’t noticed him enter the deck, but she hadn’t cared when he got there, as long as he was there when she decided to leave.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 22:49:05)

“Tolf! Make a record of the last ten minutes of the FTL scans and send it to my station,” she snapped, and all heads turned toward her. The silence lasted for a full second before Stella ran out of patience. “Now, Tolf. AB! Wake the frak up!”
She knew she didn’t need to yell; LTC Blake was already standing, shaking the sleep from his head, the instant she first spoke. But the thunderhead pushed against the inside of her skull, refusing any hesitation. “Yes, sir?”
“Get me Ensign Barrack.” Stella began tap on the controls of her command chair, arranging three screens to show the FTL scans.
“He’s-“ LTC Blake started to say, but Stella cut him off.
“I already know he’s off shift. Get him!” LTC Blake’s face twitched, caught half way between a flinch and a snarl, but he was off the deck in seconds. Stella didn’t intend her second to fetch the ensign personally, but she didn’t waste any effort to correct the action. She had bigger things on her mind. Tolf finally sent the requested data to the command chair, and Stella arranged the screens. She found where the pattern changed almost instantly, but left it scrolling across the designated screen. Next to it, she put the current data stream going, and put last week’s data on the third screen. *Yes, there is a difference. But what does it mean?* she wondered. She decided she might be chasing her own boredom. Was she really bored enough to pursue something she would never understand without twenty years of intense school?
*Yes. I* am *that bored.* Behind her, she could hear the scientists scurrying over their data, trying to see what she saw. Her enhanced hearing caught whispers complaining about the captain losing her mind, but she ignored them. Crazy or not, she would be in command of this vessel until it returned home, or she was killed.
Ensign Barrack entered the bridge, followed by the LTC. The junior officer was panting and sweating from the trip, but LTC Blake, in keeping with his reputation of invulnerability, merely looked annoyed. The ensign huffed out a quick “Sir,” and a salute, both of which Stella ignored.
“Ensign, look at these. Tell me what you see,” Stella snapped, moving the screens to the side so he can got a better view of the sensor scans. Barrack started to lean forward to follow the scrolling data, but jerked back at the entrance of his commander’s personal space.
“Me, sir? But I’m not-“
“You’re not a FTL puke, I got that. But you look at this crap every time they start that frakking engine, when no one is looking. So tell me what you see.” The ensign flinched, a conspirator caught in the act. It was against regulations to re-task a station, unless ordered to by the captain of the ship. A simple ensign wasn’t supposed to even know how to do it. Stella, who had been monitoring what her bridge crew was doing for the past eighty-six days, didn’t care.
“Uh,” he said. “Sir, I don’t- wait.” He leaned in closer as the break in the pattern she detected occurred. “Oh, wow, that’s interesting…” He leaned in closer, breaking protocol and her personal space, but both were too entrapped by the data streams to notice. “Um, it’s…here. This is the last scan, right? Uh, sir?” he asked, tapping the correct screen.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 22:52:21)

“Yes,” she answered, and then tapped another screen. “This is the current data. And this is from-“ she checked the chrono-“ twenty-two minutes ago. Can you-“ Stella stopped, feeling a presence behind her. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw Tolf opposite Barrack and leaning the side of her chair. Tolf felt the ice of Stella’s glare, and instantly retreated, returning to her own screens. “Can you tell me what that means?” she asked Barrack.
“That’s…I think that’s the long range gravity fields. It’s…uh, it compares them to the scan it did earlier in the day.” The ensign looked toward the FTL crew, as if to indicate they were a better source to ask, but Stella grabbed his ear, and pulled him back to the screens.
“You saw it, they didn’t. Now tell me what you see.” She snapped, releasing her grip on his ear. The flesh under her thumb was red.
“Ah, yes sir.” He looked back at the screens while she watched his face. “We, uh, this is measuring the dust particles, and this is a thermal reader, and this is some kind of radio reader…” his voice trailed off as he read the scrolling data. His fingers tapped on her keyboard- another breech of protocol neither noticed- slowing the current data stream, as well as that of last week’s test. “Uh…”
“What. Do. You. See?” she asked pointedly, biting each word.
“Um,” the Ensign turned to answer, and noticed how close their faces were. He stiffened, locked under her gaze, and sweat beading on his forehead. He started to breath quickly, and Stella was give the impression of a rabbit before a wolf.
“Breathe, ensign,” she told him. When he didn’t respond, she tried again, struggling to pull any menace out of her voice. “Breathe. It’s a necessity of life. Breathe.” Finally, he caught his breath and started to breathe normally, if rapidly. She waited a moment, until her patience was once again stretched to its limit. “Are you good? Can you talk?” The ensign nodded dumbly. She gripped his chin and turned his face back to the screens. “Now, tell me what you see. And don’t forget to breathe.”
“It’s- it’s a pocket, sir,” Barrack answered. “At least, that’s what it looks like. It’s a pocket, and…uh, it’s growing. Everything is moving away from it.”
Stella nodded, and then looked back at the scientists. “Can you confirm that?” Tolf shook her head- more in disbelief than in denial- and turned back to her screens. Seconds later, she looked up from her screens to stare at ensign Barrack, and then to Stella. *That’s answer enough,* the Colonel thought.
“Sir, there is a pocket growing, and, uh, has been for…” Tolf looked at her screens. “It’s been growing for at least for twenty hours. The rate of growth has been slowly increasing since we came into the area, and-“
“It’s growing fast enough, now, that I could notice it. Got it, Tolf,” she snapped. “Space itself is getting out of the way of something, and now it’s almost here. *Battle stations!*” The crew instantly reacted, diving into the drills they never thought they would use on this trip. But the *November 11* was a military vessel, first and foremost, and test bed for the FTL second. The bridge was filled with a flurry of activity as the lights shifted to red and the alarm sounded.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 22:58:49)

“Battle stations, battle stations! This is not a drill,” the LTC Blake’s voice called over the intercom. She swiped the FTL data from her screens, and brought up her combat data. Input from the weapons and navigation sections appeared. She left the pre-battle checks to her second, her mind already struggling to make sense of it all.
*Am I making a super nova from a firefly?* She wondered as LTC Blake commanded the ship to move away from the suspected entry point. *Was it an entry point? Is there really something going to appear, right here? What am I thinking?* She pushed these thoughts aside to focus on what her crew was doing. She acknowledged her doubts, chose a path, and now she would reap the results. “AB, keep us inside of missile range,” she commanded. “I want to be able to slag it if it’s hostile. Tolf, can you determine a direction and speed from the data?”
“I can try, ma’am- sir,” the scientist answered. Stella wasn’t looking behind her, but her ear told her Tolf was facing her screens, fingers flying over the keys.
“Is it possible, Tolf?” Stella clarified. “If it is, do it.”
“I don’t know, Sir. I’m not even sure it’s possible to detect a FTL entering a system, in the first place.” Tolf answered. But her fingers didn’t stop their work.
Stella could feel the storm roll in her brain, with lighting arcing throughout her mind, the crashing thunder in prefect time with the data stream. “It’s possible. You’re looking at it right now,” she answered grimly. *It has to be,* she thought. *Because if it’s not, I* am *going crazy.*
The seconds ticked by slowly. Stella gritted her teeth, struggling to take control over each and every station instead of allowing the crew members to do their job. *AB is doing a fine job,* she told herself. *He is an excellent XO. He knows what he is doing, and what you want. Let him be.* Her hand tightened on the arm of her chair as each command was sent, just a half second slower than what she wanted. *It is his shift, after all,* she tried to reason. It failed to make a difference.
“Here, I constructed some graphical data,” Tolf said, and Stella looked to her screens. It was choppy and was definitely a rushed job, but Stella could feel that it was accurate.
“Good enough. Push it to the main screen. AB,” she shifted to her XO. “I want to be off those coordinates by 45 degrees and-“
“Done and done, sir,” LTC Blake answered, pointing at the large viewer at the front of the bridge. Within the narrow borders of the screen, bright stars and muted sun dotted otherwise prefect blackness. A light sphere of red- Tolf’s data super imposing itself over the empty space- misted into existence. Yellow lines slowly expanded from the spread, spreading out to project the possible- or rather, suspected- path of the oncoming craft. In Stella’s mind the empty void that had enveloped her ship just seconds ago now has an object in it. “All tubes are full, and the railed are loaded. Which colony do you think it is? Do we load the solutions into the missiles, now, sir? Or we can give wide spread…”
Stella paused, looking at her weapons station, which, in turn, looked back at her expectantly. The firing solution for the missiles prevented them from locking on to friendly ships and to lock onto specific parts of those ships. But considering how many of the colonies had Prime ships, the commanders often waited until the battle started- until they knew exactly which ship was on whose side- to load the solutions. Every Prime ship held all the known colonial specs stored in its battle computer, but sometimes the colonials adjusted their ships, just enough to through off the normal solutions. The normal procedure for engaging an unknown enemy was to load each missile with a different solution, encompassing as many of the standard colonial ships as one ship could.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 23:02:43)

But, Stella had always known who she was attacking. More accurately, she could reasonably deduce what kinds of ships she was about to engage, even if they were masking themselves. At that instance, she truly didn’t know what to expect. No ship, not even a sister Prime ship, should be out in this sector. She couldn’t fathom what kind she was expecting. The only thing she could think was that the storm in her head was about to break, and she didn’t have a solution of her missiles.
“None. Don’t load anything. Franklin!” she called to the nightshift sensor captain. “I want a focused scan the moment that thing drops into real space. Grant,” the weapons captain looked at her, but still couldn’t met Stella’s gaze. “Be prepared to fire dry.” Grant nodded, and turned to her weapons personnel. “But I don’t want a single tick leaving tubes until I say so. Understood?”
“Yes, sir,” came the brisk reply. Stella turned back to the main viewer. An overlay appeared on screen were the astrogation computer suggested the entrance point, but Stella didn’t see anything. Quietly, she shifted her personal screen to show thermal, electromagnetic, and ultraviolet spectrums. One after another failed to show any visual signs, though the data streams said there were minute changes. She could almost hear the thunder crackling in her skull. *Any moment,* she thought. *I just wish there was something to back up the feeling.*
Her ears twitched, and she became aware of a new sound on the bridge. Harsh whispering came from behind her, and Stella turned to see the source of the noise. Kolender was there, pulling at Tolf’s arm as if to lift the other scientists out of her chair, despite the fact she was strapped in. Stella didn’t have to listen in to know that Kolender was pulling rank- more likely seniority- and trying to relieve Tolf of her post. Tolf, naturally, wasn’t inclined to give up her post. “AB, take care of that,” she said quietly.
Her XO moved without hesitation, appearing next to the two struggling scientists suddenly enough to bring a startled gasp from Tolf. Stella turned back to rest of the bridge and put on her best return-to-your-business glare. The faces that were turned toward the FTL sector immediately returned to their own systems and engaged in something more important. Behind her, she could hear LTC Blake curtly explain to Kolender that Tolf “was the first geek on the scene, so she’s the geek in the seat”. Kolender started to protest, but Blake promised him a seat on the sidelines, or a seat in the brig. Quietly, the older scientist took a seat away from the FTL stations.
“AB,” she said whispered as the XO returned to his position on her right. He stood in front of his seat, instead of sitting. Procedure called for all personnel to be strapped while the ship was at battle stations, but Stella had seen the man stand steady during missile impacts.
“Sir?” the XO replied, just as softly.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 23:06:55)

“Geek in the seat?” she asked incredulously.
“Seemed appropriate,” he answered. She could hear the smirk in his voice. “And, if I may ask, where did ‘real space’ come from? You know you might have just coined a phrase?”
Stella snorted. “If I’m in it, it’s real. Everything else is something else.”
“Something that can wait?” LTC Blake asked, without a hint of expecting an answer. Stella bite off her answer as the main screen- as every screen- awoke with color.
It lasted only a second, but the blackness exploded with light. The first burst was wide and unfocused, but the following blazes were expanding rings of blue light, flashing out for hundreds of kilometers perpendicular to the...it was a space ship. There was no denying it. The rapidly decelerating object was still unclear, as the last vestiges of its FTL engine flaked off in wisps of violet and yellow energy clouds. A series of blue lightning bolts gripped at the edges of the new ship, as if trying to pull the ship back into the unseen place FTL travel was possible. Stella was caught up in the display, wondering if that was what it looked like when *November 11* dropped out of FTL.
“Target locked!” Grant yelled across the bridge, and ship on the main screen was bracketed by ugly red lines.
“Passive lock only, captain!” Stella answered back. “That’s not colonial. Franklin, what is that thing?”
The sensor commander looked up at her, his face the image of confusion. “I have no idea sir. A ship, but it’s not…it’s not colonial. And it’s not one of ours.”
“No frakking gap, captain. I know what it isn’t. Tell me what it *is!*” The scolded captain turned back to his system operators, and snapped orders. Growling at the kneejerk lashing the captain was giving; she had to bite her cheek to keep from undermining her subordinate. It took the XO’s hand on her shoulder of focus on task at hand.
The ship in question was smooth, a stark comparison to any Prime or colonial ship Stella had ever seen. Its sides appeared more like the sides of some rippled whale than a space craft. There was no visible view port, yet a series of lights shined across the hull, positioned as if to cast shadows that extenuate is wondrous construction. It was elegant, beautiful, and threatened to drive Stella stark raving mad.
“Who makes a ship like that?” LTC Blake asked aloud. Stella ignored him, and called to Captain Franklin.
“It’s uh…those engines are similar to ours, sir,” he answered. The ion trail- at least, Stella thought it looked like an ion trail- looked like what the *November 11* pushed out its backside, but it was much longer. “Ion engines, it looks like. The, uh, the hull is of a metallic compound, but the computer hasn’t figured out what yet. I don’t think they’ve noticed us yet. At least, there isn’t any sign of-“
“They’re scanning us!” Ensign Hawkins shouted from his station. As LTC Blake snapped for the anti-missile systems to be readied, Stella punched up Hawkins’s station to her command chair. The energy signature was strange, but it acted exactly like a colonial- or a Prime- scan acted. She hoped it wasn’t a weapon.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 23:09:04)

“They’re turning!” the ensign called again as the view screen caught up with the sensor operator. The strange ship turned gracefully, displaying far too much litheness to be mistaken for a colonial ship. It finished its turn perpendicular to the *November 11,* strangely opposite normal battle formations. Ships of old, Stella recalled, had the majority of their weapons pointed out to the side for broad side attacks. The advent of the turret removed such tactics, but…
“Franklin, is it deploying weapons?”
“I read no energy signatures, and no target locks,” the captain replied. Stella snarled.
“*Look* at it, captain!” LTC Blake ordered before Stella had a chance to open her mouth. “Are there any open ports? You see anything pointed in our direction? Use your eyes, captain!” Again, Captain Franklin turned back to his section, and bit out a slew of scalding orders.
“Sir!” ensign Barrack called. “Ports open from bow to stern! “
“Missiles?” Stella asked hopefully. Missiles they could intercept. Beams or slugs, they couldn’t.
“Uh…looks like missiles, sir. Or slugs,” the ensign answered. It suddenly struck Stella that the ensign was off shift, and only came to the bridge because she called for him. She almost told him to leave the deck, except she hated hypocrites.
One of her screen suddenly zoomed in, and she got a good look at the open ports. They did indeed look like missiles, but not like any missile she had ever seen. They looked like sharp, wicked edged harpoons, completely unlike the blocky mass of thrusters and explosive modern missiles looked like. “Atmospheric, I think,” LTC Blake said, leaning over her shoulder. “The ship, the missiles…these guys were made to go through atmosphere.”
“No frakkin way,” Stella said. “Where’s its wing? There isn’t anything that creates lift on the whole frakking thing.”
“Anti-gravity?” her XO whispered. Stella shook her head, but secretly wondered. All of their ships- Prime and colonial- duplicated gravity by flooding the crew’s bloodstream with iron deposits and creating a magnetic field in line with the floor. True anti-gravity was still science fiction. At least, she hoped it was.
Stella caught a word from behind her, and she turned to address the FTL stations. “What?” The scientists stared at her, blank faced, like children caught doing something they knew was wrong. “What did you say? Say it again!”
“Um,” Tolf’s voice was hesitant, guarded, as if she was trying to explain away an insult. “I said- Sir, I said water. Like an ocean. It looks like a submarine. Like it’s suppose to be in the water.” Stella stared at her. Tolf actually blushed, and looked back at her screens. Stella continued to stare at the other woman.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-07 23:11:10)

“Confirmed!” Franklin called out. “There is a gap load of water aboard, Colonel. The whole thing must be filled from bow to stern.”
“Frakking hell,” Stella breathed, and stared back the strange ship. “A frakking water ship. Water breathers. Frakking…aliens!” The whole crew fell into silence, staring at the main screen. Stella felt the waves of awe, fear, and wonderment cross her heart in waves. She knew without looking her feelings were mirrored- to a greater or lesser degree- by the rest of the crew.  *Aliens. Way the frak out here. What are the chances of that?* she thought, but she knew the answer. The storm still brewing in the back of her skull told her that.
“Grant, close the missile tubes, but leave the ticks hot,” she said, instantly. “Franklin, I want to know if they are trying to communicate. AB, I want someone who knows fish up here, on the double. And get me a legal officer.”
“Er…what?“ the XO asked, thoroughly confused. The blank stare she was still getting from the weapons officer told not just LTC Blake was shocked by the recent news. Her patience shot, she lashed out.
“Grant! Missiles, closed! Close the frakking missile tubes! They are our most visible weapons and I want those frakking fish to see us shut down some weapons. Franklin! They haven’t fired yet, so they don’t know what to do with us. They are likely trying to talk to us. Find me some weird signal that isn’t a scanner. Strange radio frequencies, light pulses, anything. See if there is something written on the hull of that…thing. AB,” she snarled at her XO. “A marine biologist, whaler, a frakking Sunday fisherman. I give a gap. Get me *someone*. And I want a frakking legal officer, *yesterday*!”
The crew exploded back into action. Seething in her chair, Stella said nothing as Grant reported the missile tubes retracted, but the heavy rails were still tracking the other ship. Franklin did in fact find a strange signal, likely to be some kind of communication transmission, but its format- *whatever he meant by that,* she thought- was unlike anything he had ever seen. He was still trying to make sense of it when the legal officer appeared on the deck.
“Adjutant Foreman, reporting as ordered, sir!” his manner was brisk, and he even managed a quick salute before his eyes were lost in the main view screen. Stella called the adjutant his name twice without response. The XO, sensing her urgency, slapped the legal officer and sent him sprawling to the deck. The adjutant was caught between trying to figure out if he was still being attacked and staring at the alien space craft.
“Foreman! Eyes front!” Stella snapped. Finally, the legal officer looked at her, and his eyes lost some of their glaze. “Foreman, I need you to tell me if there is a procedure for First Contact.”
“What?” he sputtered, his hand unconsciously going to his reddened cheek. “You mean that-“
“Is there a procedure for ships making first contact?” Stella repeated. “It’s a yes or no question. Answer it!”

“Uh…yes?” the adjutant answered. “Do you need it?”
“Sir!” Franklin called. “They are closing their weapon ports! They saw us close our missiles!”
“All of them?” Stella asked.
“Uh…” the sensor officer looked back at his screen. “Uh, no. It looks like…half of them.”
“Why only half?” Stella wondered.
LTC Blake answered that as she turned back to the adjutant. “Because they can see our rails are tracking them. They’re not stupid.” He sighed, as if getting confirmation of bad news he was already certain of. “Pity, that.”
Stella nodded, and then addressed Foreman. “I’d rather you give it brief. What is it? Laymen’s terms.”
“Well,” Adjutant Foreman started, and Stella watched his eyes drift back toward the main screen. Suddenly looked back at her, and, as if he could feel her stare, flinched. He turned his eyes to the floor. “The short version is that the ship in question is to say as little as possible, and have the, er, outsiders talk directly to a representative appointed by the parliament. You are to avoid allowing the…er, the outsiders to talk to the colonials, you are not to lead them back to the Prime, and…oh, you are to insure you inform the parliament that you have made First Contact.”
“So…nothing,” Stella summarized. “There really is no procedure.”
“Pretty much,” Foreman agreed. “I mean, can you really make a doctrine for something like, like, like…” his eyes drifted to the elegant craft still circling them like a wary shark.
“Yes, I frakking can,” Stella snapped. “Watch, I’m about to do it right now. Franklin!”
“Sir!”
“Have you figured out that signal yet?” The sensor operator looked up from his crew, glanced at the main screen, and then addressed his commander.
“I sent out an audio and visual signal to them, and started adjusting things from there, sir. It took a minute, but they started adjusting their signal to match with ours.”
“Short answer, Franklin. I’m getting twitchy with just half they’re missiles trained on us. You can bet they are feeling the same thing,” she snapped. She struggled to get her emotions under control. She was about to establish First Contact, and she didn’t want to start a war. Her reputation, after all, dealt with finishing them. Not starting them.
“Yes, sir!” Franklin answered. “It’s gonna be choppy, but we’ll work on it while…we’ll work on it.”
“It takes two to tango, Franklin. Let’s get to it,” she smoothed out the front of her uniform, and took a deep breath. Then she suddenly remembered an order she gave LTC Blake. “AB, where’s that fish guy?”
“The adjutant is an avid fly fisher,” LTC Blake answered with a smirk. *When did he get so brave?* She wondered. “Best I found.”
“I do not like your sense of humor, AB,” Stella whispered as the stood to face the main screen. She took another deep breath, and gave a quick prayer to the gods. The storm was ready to break. “Frak it. Let’s make history, shall we?”

Ah, my thanks.
I sent it to my sister. Her responce? "Wow! Very nice! Who did you write it with? I know you didn't write it alone because it was a little upbeat and everyone in the story was still alive at the end."

The translation from there to here caused a bit of weird things to happen to the story, so I re-reported it. With minor changes. And I am working on *Second Contact*.
