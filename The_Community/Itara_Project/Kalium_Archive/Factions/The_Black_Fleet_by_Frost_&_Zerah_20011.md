The Black Fleet
Some call them pirates, criminals, smugglers, and even worse. They have been around for centuries; their origin has been the heart of many tall tales told in cantinas. They pillage and plunder the space lanes with no fear of reprisal from the Hutts or any other law. No one is sure of their numbers; no one has ever seen the entire Fleet at once. They hide in the Deep Core where supernovas have created asteroid fields that span for parsecs and black holes and nebulas make hyperspace travel nearly impossible. The Fleet has been there long enough to have established several secret paths allowing them to travel through the core rather than around it.
The fleet has multiple bases and fortresses hidden through out the Deep Core but for the most part they use their mobility to their advantage. The Fleets goals are obscure to say the least, they strike well armed and defended targets without hesitation but unarmed or smaller targets can usually bribe their way out of trouble or are left alone altogether.
The Black Fleet is really several different fleets of ships each run by their elected captains. These Captains answer to The Black Lord who started the pirates so long ago. This Black Lord is the final authority on the actions of the entire fleet. In order to join the Black Fleet every pirate swears an oath of loyalty to the Black Lord. If He calls you must answer and obey. No one can remember the last time he called the Fleet together as a whole. The Captains form a council of eight that makes decisions for actions and sectors of control. The Black lord has the right to veto and has the tie breaking decision if necessary.
To society, the Fleet was a lawless band of thieves who lacked honor and respect. Among themselves, however, they had a strict code of conduct that ensured democracy. The agreement to work together provided for the spacers psychological needs and ensured some security. Pirates accused of misconduct were tried by their crew mates, who decided their guilt or innocence and what punishment was justified. At the beginning of a new voyage, or upon the election of a new captain, new articles would be drawn up. Each man signed, or marked if they were illiterate, their agreement to the articles.
All pirates agreed to obey civil command, and were promised equal say in all decisions. The captain was elected by the crew. While the ship's captain had absolute authority, he could be removed by the crew if they disapproved of his conduct. Every code designated how loot would be divided. Usually, crew members each received one share, while the captain and other high-ranking members might receive as many as two shares. Food and drink was shared equally, and only if the common good required it would the crew be asked to give back their share to divvy up among all members.
Those caught stealing from fellow crew could have their ears and nose slit, and be put ashore. Anyone defrauding the ship could be marooned on a habitable planet, and given only water, a blaster pistol and a power pack. Pirates agreed to keep their weapons clean and ready for battle at all times; anyone who didn't might lose their share of the loot.
Striking another pirate on board was prohibited, and offenders were punished with 40 lashes across the back. Quarrels were to be settled on shore, by a duel. Those keeping secrets from the company, or planning to desert, would be marooned. No one was allowed to leave the crew until each member had made 5000-7000 credits. Pirates who lost a limb were given enough credits to buy a cybernetic replacement. Families of those killed were given money as well.
Type: Outlaw gang
Enemies and Allies: The Hutts are the biggest threat to the Black Fleet. There are several other pirate groups that occasionally clash with the Black Fleet. The Rom is the fleets closest and most protected allies. The Dark Lord uses the information gathered by the Rom to plan his attacks and his action. Only the Captainâ€™s council knows about the Rom and they are far to useful to give up.
Scale: 12 (Multiple systems)
Organization Score Criteria: Becoming a member of the Black Fleet involves finding them and proving your worth. Then once you are deemed worthy you must swear a blood oath to the Dark Lord. If he gives you his blessing you will be assigned to a fleet. Once you are part of a crew then you officially have a voice in the democratic process of the pirateâ€™s life.

Rank/Score/Title
0/ 3 or lower/ None
1/ 4-10/ Deck Hand: Deck hands provide the grunt work of the ship from scrubbing the refreshers to repelling borders. 1/encounter a deck hand can gain a +2 bonus to an aid another activity this does not stack with coordination talent or rapport feat.
2/ 11-20/ Officer: Officers are the leaders amongst the crew. They have a decent level of responsibility and at least a few crew members are under their direct control. Officers are considered to have favorable conditions when making persuasion checks in the Fleets sphere of influence
3/ 21-35/ Corsair: Corsairs are captains of ships that are not capital size, they are the back bone of the Fleet. Corsairs do a majority of the raiding and smuggling for the fleet while the capital ships handle the bigger targets. Corsairs automatically gain command of a colossal space transport valued at 500,000 credits or less.
4/ 36-45/ Captain: Captains in the Black Fleet usually command frigates or corvettes (and the occasional Mustang). A captain gains command of a capital ship valued at no more than 3,000,000 credits
I used the Car'das smugglers and Lok Revenants from TFU book as guidelines. Alot of the fluff is based on actual pirates articles and codes found on various sites around the holo-net.
