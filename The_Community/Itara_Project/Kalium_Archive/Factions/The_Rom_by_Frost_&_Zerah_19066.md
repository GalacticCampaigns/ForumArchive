The Rom
"Information is true power.â€ This is the religion of the Rom. They spread out through out the galaxy as entertainers and celebrities. They use their influence to gain access to high level people and information. The Rom then collects this information and analyzes its usefulness then sells it to the higher bidder. The Rom has agents placed through out the galaxy to feed them information. The Rom is actually the intelligence division for the Black Fleet all information gathered is relayed to the fleet.
Type: Business/professional
Enemies and Allies: Everyone has secret and no one wants their secrets discovered or much less sold. The information game always has its enemies and its allies and they usually change from day to day.
Scale: 15 (galactic region)
Organization Score Criteria: Becoming a member of the Rom in any meaningful capacity means earning trust through the collection of useful information.

Rank/Score/ Title: Benefits and Duties
0/ 3 or lower/None
1/ 4-8/ Informer: An informer is a low level member of the Rom who passes along information and rarely works directly for the Rom. Gather info is a class skill for Rom informers
2/9-18/ Scouts: Scouts are the lowest member of the Rom with any real idea of what the Rom truly does. They scout out possible recruits from popular musicians and actors. They then use these actors and celebrities as assets for information and access. Scouts can re-roll a failed persuasion check to change attitudes using the best result.
3/19-30/ B-list: These people have infiltrated the lower levels of their cultures entertainment industry. They are the Holo-vision stars or lower budget holovids. These people are expected to exert influence and gather useful info based on their status. The Rom has used their ties to increase the market ability of these upcoming stars. B-list stars pay no money when making a gather-info check, even when obtaining secret info.
4/31 or higher/A-list: The A-list is the top of the entertainment world, they are celebrities of the highest order. They wield power over the masses and thus power over society. They have fans across the galaxy and are always in the heart of any social scene. A-list stars can make persuasion checks to change attitude on the number of people equal to their level at one time. (Normally it is one at a time)
*This is my rough draft for a spy organization that Zerah and I have been working on. Alot of the basic stuff has been stolen from the Bothan spynet organization from the Force Unleashed*

I like the idea of the celebrity spy organization, though it still needs work (as you pointed out). A little less like the Bothan SpyNet, and maybe a little more like Hollywood. As a spy group of celebrities, I think it could be more sensational. That's just my opinion, anyway.

I like the idea so far. The religious idea is cool, they could have awhole Church of Information where they look at it as there calling. They have decons and otheer church officals that sort the info and filiter out what is junk from gold. The gathers could be refored to as "Bother" Maybe give them like insenant recall when sending info to the church or some kind of speical holorecorded that is bioenginered into them.

Reworked some of the benifits of ranks. just a few modifications what do you think?
Rank/Score/ Title: Benefits and Duties
0/ 3 or lower/None
1/ 4-8/ Fan: Fans are low level member of the Rom who passes along information and rarely works directly for the Rom. Fans gain a +5 bonus to gather information when requested by a B-list or A-list celeberty
2/9-18/ Scouts: Scouts are the lowest member of the Rom with any real idea of what the Rom truly does. They scout out possible recruits from popular musicians and actors.

I think it seems a little powerful for the two lowest titles. When comparing to the Bothan Spynet:
**Gather Information as a class skill vs +5 to all Gather Information checks**
My opinion, your is far more powerful.
**Reroll any Knowledge check 1/day, keep better result vs Reroll any failed Persuasion check to change attitude**
My opinion, yours is far more powerful, because it is not limited in useage, and can be used on a far better skill application.
I have just compared your organization to the spynet since they are similar, and apparently the devs thought that the spynets abilities were good enough for those levels. Perhaps yours will be a little unbalanced since they are so much more powerful.

Ok so how about giving them a +2 morale bonus for Fans to gather info instead of a +5?
As far as the persuasion skill goes it only can be used for the attitude change portion of the skill nothing else.

+2 could probably work, it seems more balanced.
> As far as the persuasion skill goes it only can be used for the attitude change portion of the skill nothing else.

ThatÂ´s the most useful application of the skill, and since it can normally not be retried within 24 hours if failed, a reroll is very useful, even more so if you can keep the better result. Perhaps you could say that it can only be used against a single character per day. That way it would be pretty much like the Bothan Spynet version, but still affects a more powerful skill application, and allows you to attempt 2 Persuasion checks within the same 24 hours against that character.

> +2 could probably work, it seems more balanced.

I also made it a named bonus so it can't be stacked with other morale bonuses

so 1/day can re-roll a persuation check to change attitudes keeping the higher roll?
or just they have to keep the re-roll even if its worse?

keep the better result.
of course, these are only suggestions.

Looks cool so far. i will have to admit that i havn't read alot of the stuff for the Bothan Spy net. I know they are the information brokers for the galaxy. I think it would be even better if the the Rom where not a race but a group of people that belive in the power of information. I guess that is how i see it.

They aren't a race. They are a group of people who belive in the power and use of information

**The Black Fleet**
Some call them pirates, criminals, smugglers, and even worse. They have been around for centuries; their origin has been the heart of many tall tales told in cantinas. They pillage and plunder the space lanes with no fear of reprisal from the Hutts or any other law. No one is sure of their numbers; no one has ever seen the entire Fleet at once. They hide in the Deep Core where supernovas have created asteroid fields that span for parsecs and black holes and nebulas make hyperspace travel nearly impossible. The Fleet has been there long enough to have established several secret paths allowing them to travel through the core rather than around it.
The fleet has multiple bases and fortresses hidden through out the Deep Core but for the most part they use their mobility to their advantage. The Fleets goals are obscure to say the least, they strike well armed and defended targets without hesitation but unarmed or smaller targets can usually bribe their way out of trouble or are left alone altogether.
The Black Fleet is really several different fleets of ships each run by their elected captains. These Captains answer to The Black Lord who started the pirates so long ago. This Black Lord is the final authority on the actions of the entire fleet. In order to join the Black Fleet every pirate swears an oath of loyalty to the Black Lord. If He calls you must answer and obey. No one can remember the last time he called the Fleet together as a whole. The Captains form a council of eight that makes decisions for actions and sectors of control. The Black lord has the right to veto and has the tie breaking decision if necessary.
To society, the Fleet was a lawless band of thieves who lacked honor and respect. Among themselves, however, they had a strict code of conduct that ensured democracy. The agreement to work together provided for the spacers psychological needs and ensured some security. Pirates accused of misconduct were tried by their crew mates, who decided their guilt or innocence and what punishment was justified. At the beginning of a new voyage, or upon the election of a new captain, new articles would be drawn up. Each man signed, or marked if they were illiterate, their agreement to the articles.
All pirates agreed to obey civil command, and were promised equal say in all decisions. The captain was elected by the crew. While the ship's captain had absolute authority, he could be removed by the crew if they disapproved of his conduct. Every code designated how loot would be divided. Usually, crew members each received one share, while the captain and other high-ranking members might receive as many as two shares. Food and drink was shared equally, and only if the common good required it would the crew be asked to give back their share to divvy up among all members.
Those caught stealing from fellow crew could have their ears and nose slit, and be put ashore. Anyone defrauding the ship could be marooned on a habitable planet, and given only water, a blaster pistol and a power pack. Pirates agreed to keep their weapons clean and ready for battle at all times; anyone who didn't might lose their share of the loot.
Striking another pirate on board was prohibited, and offenders were punished with 40 lashes across the back. Quarrels were to be settled on shore, by a duel. Those keeping secrets from the company, or planning to desert, would be marooned. No one was allowed to leave the crew until each member had made 5000-7000 credits. Pirates who lost a limb were given enough credits to buy a cybernetic replacement. Families of those killed were given money as well.
Type: Outlaw gang
Enemies and Allies: The Hutts are the biggest threat to the Black Fleet. There are several other pirate groups that occasionally clash with the Black Fleet. The Rom is the fleets closest and most protected allies. The Dark Lord uses the information gathered by the Rom to plan his attacks and his action. Only the Captainâ€™s council knows about the Rom and they are far to useful to give up.
Scale: 12 (Multiple systems)
Organization Score Criteria: Becoming a member of the Black Fleet involves finding them and proving your worth. Then once you are deemed worthy you must swear a blood oath to the Dark Lord. If he gives you his blessing you will be assigned to a fleet. Once you are part of a crew then you officially have a voice in the democratic process of the pirateâ€™s life.
Positive Criteria
Character level +1/2 character level
Has levels in scoundrel class +1
Has levels in Master Privateer prestige class +1
Trained in pilot +1
Has a spacer talent or smugglers talent +1
Has Vehicle Combat Feat +1
Has WP(Advanced) Feat +1
Discovers new hyperspace route through core +1
Prevents capture or death of Rom agent +2
Has Hutt Bounty on head +2

Damages or destroys cargo -1 per 10,000 credit value
Betrays another pirate or crew mate to authorities -10
Gives up details of hyperspace routes through Deep Core -10
Provides information to Law enforcement about Black Fleet activities -15
Rank/Score/Title
0/ 3 or lower/ None
1/ 4-10/ Deck Hand: Deck hands provide the grunt work of the ship from scrubbing the refreshers to repelling borders. 1/encounter a deck hand can gain a +2 bonus to an aid another activity this does not stack with coordination talent or rapport feat.
2/ 11-20/ Officer: Officers are the leaders amongst the crew. They have a decent level of responsibility and at least a few crew members are under their direct control. Officers are considered to have favorable conditions when making persuasion checks in the Fleets sphere of influence
3/ 21-35/ Corsair: Corsairs are captains of ships that are not capital size, they are the back bone of the Fleet. Corsairs do a majority of the raiding and smuggling for the fleet while the capital ships handle the bigger targets. Corsairs automatically gain command of a colossal space transport valued at 500,000 credits or less.
4/ 36-45/ Captain: Captains in the Black Fleet usually command frigates or corvettes (and the occasional Mustang). A captain gains command of a capital ship valued at no more than 3,000,000 credits
*I used the Car'das smugglers and Lok Revenants from TFU book as guidelines. Alot of the fluff is based on actual pirates articles and codes found on various sites around the holo-net*

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-28 14:51:00)

I like it.
One question, though. Should their Scale be larger? If they only pillage the space lanes through the Deep Core (and maybe the Core), the Scale is right. But I got the impression (so correct me if I'm wrong) that they pillage the space lanes all across the galaxy, so it should be close to Multiple Sectors, methinks.
That would put it on par with the Bounty Hunter's Guild or the Car'das Smugglers, which seems right to me.
