still working on it....
Zarell Coalition
The Zarell Coalition was so named for the human diplomat, Kaitlyn Zarell, who brought together a diverse group of species and got them to ally with each other after the devastating attacks from the sith. The Zarell Coalition consists of only a few worlds (number still being decided), Hyperis, Oâ€™an, Fothayn, Tsloi, and New Moncada, Bandor, Tizan, Zatera, and Tanzat. Hundreds of years ago, during the time of the Galactic Protectorate, many species refused to join it, and resisted its influence, as the Galactic Protectorate acted like little more than thugs. When the Sith attacked from Firaxia, chaos erupted. The Galactic Protectorate fought them, but every battle was a loss for them. After a devastating loss at Tinn (or some other planet maybe), a Jedi arrived in the galaxy, with her fighter squadron. She met with the Galactic Protectorate officials, but was disheartened by their corruption, and so did not join them. On her way to leave the Core, she stopped at the planet New Moncada to refuel and resupply. She witnessed a young woman attempting to rally others to stand together and fight the SIth. The Jedi, Ara Noor, was heartened to see someone so idealistic, so inspiring, and so approached her, to join her in fighting the Sith. With Ara Noorâ€™s help, the young woman, Kaitlyn Zarell managed to convince many people from New Moncada, Bandor, Fothayn, and even the Zabrakâ€™s, who had not been part of the Galactic Protectorate to unite. With the Jedi Ara Noor recruiting the Bendu, the Psylan, and the Ysanna, they manage to defeat the Sith in the devastating Battle of Firaxia. The Sith fleets flee, and peace ensues. Kaitlyn becomes the first Head of State, and changes the galaxy with her fiery ideals and values. Unfortunately, while many planets did join the Zarell Coalition, others, like the Ysanna and the Psylan, disagreed, as they believed the galaxy would be better off run their way. While Kaitlyn and Ara Noor made every attempt to convince them to reconsider, but the Ysanna and Psylan would not do so, and left to their respective planets. The Bendu as well left, as theirsâ€™ was a life of meditation, and the time for them to act was over. Ara Noor though, stayed with the Zarell Coalition and eventually built a new Jedi Order, with training centers on many Zarell Coalition planets. While the first few years are difficult for the Zarell Coalition, with the extensive rebuilding needed on many worlds, the Zarell Coalition soon flourishes afterwards, becoming a powerful, yet benevolent government. Such a golden age would not last forever though. Long after its founding, the Zarell Coalition slowly became clogged with corruption, slowly dragging it down. Many groups, especially the Psylan, the Jensaarai, and the Ysanna called out for an end to this corruption, with many from those orders promising to do it themselves if necessary. This caused much friction with the Jedi, who believed in peaceful routes.

This strikes me a a rather large faction, with almost a dozen planets in it. Or maybe I'm just looking a it wrong, considering the millions of planets and hundreds (if not thousands) of species out there.
Any way, my real point is the very large number of Force Traditions tied to its existence. I think you got most of the big orders tied into it. Is this what you were looking to do? If so, cool.
On to questions/details:
What are the goals of this faction? What would you call its strengths? The faction's weaknesses? What species make up the bulk of the population? Does this faction have any strong enemies? Do the planets that make up this faction have a overabundance or lack of a natural or processed resource?

leave it to breeder to ask the big questions. I'll come up with some answers later, though i can say that humans, bandorans, and zabraks are the most populous species (though not the only ones)

I am a big fan of making 'realistic' organizations and people. A flaw or two, an odd detail or three, vastly improve the feel of a character or organization.
At least, in my mind. But, sinse this whole site is dedicated to pleasing me and spreading the wealth of my ideals, of course I need to tell you about them.
