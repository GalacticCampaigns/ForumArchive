# The Reaping

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 23:29:42)

The Reaping are a mysterious group of cyborgs and droids. They operate as mercenaries, capturing ships and buildings for the right price. Most people think of them as a menace, rogue droids and cyborgs, while in reality, they are the servants of the little known Cadans. The Reapings most common tactic for capturing ships is to turn off the power in their droid systems, and then ambush the ship when it is in system and gets closer to take a look. Another effective tactic is to have a protocol droid or astromech droid with specialized hacking programming left on a ship, only to be taken aboard by the target, allowing it to hack the computers of the target afterwards, making it quite easy to capture or kill the target.
Reaping follow their objectives to the letter whenever possible, willing to sacrifice personnel and equipment to achieve their mission goal. Generally, it is very difficult to contact the Reaping for a mission (unless you have high level contacts on Cadasia), but if you can contact them with enough cash, theyâ€™ll take on almost any mission. It takes a DC 35 gather information check to contact the Reaping for a mission, (though having contacts in the government can reduce the DC by 5 or more). The Cadan government often sends the Reaping on missions for their own gain, though this is very hard to find knowledge.

This is an example of an astromech that the Reaping would use to capture certain bases or ships. These droids are programmed to act inconspicuous, and then sneaking off and slicing into the computer mainframes, giving the Reaping warriors full access, or otherwise making the target a sitting duck. Even if the droid is placed in containment, it possesses the skills to break out, even without any tools at all.

I give credit for the idea of "trojan astromechs" to breeder of puppets though.

Trojan protocol droids are used by the Reaping more often as spies than to perform actual sabotage, though the droid is capable of that. Trojan protocol droids have advanced lying software, and advanced persuasion software. These droids are used to enlist agents inside an enemies' base or ship, often just by invoking the threat of the Reaping. Once these agents serve their purposes, most meet an unfortunate end to this droid, though a few have escaped these droids.

What little I actually wrote up before the overwhelming happened.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Reaping
*"Don't try to define me. Definitions are cages, and you can't hold the Reaping."*
â€• Corporal Debra Kane 02, soldier of the Reaping
"Heartless Cyborgs."
"Droid-men murders and thieves of the worst order."
"Lethal. The best money can buy."
All of these phrases and more have described the soldiers of the Reaping. All are accurate, to one degree or another. Every last member of the Reaping is skilled combatant implanted with cybernetics, or a droid outfitted with combat chips and battle gear. Every last one is a warrior to one degree or another. They charge heavily for their services, and are not adverse to looting anything they best in combat. They are expensive, but are worth every credit.
They are the Reaping.
**History**
*"My Lord, I would advise a halt in your violent pursuit of Hath's killers. The Reaping has claimed them as their part of their fifth. Need I remind you that interfering with the Reaping's share is how your other sons died?"*
â€•Blen Stiller, Chief Advisor to Warlord Get de Holland, vainly attempting to correct his master's gross error
**Early history**
During the Hyperspace Wars, though many soldiers were killed, as many as a hundred times that number were injured, crippled, or maimed. Many of the injured could no longer function as self-sustaining members of their societies much less continue to their service to their military. Every culture seeks the best method on dealing with these crippled warriors. Many sought not to retire the maimed soldier, but to somehow tap into the huge resource of experience. Many methods, ranging from using expensive surgeries to employment as instructors, and to expensive surgeries and cybernetic replacements.
In desperate times, many terrible things were tried.
Those that turned to cybernetics to keep their soldiers in the field soon ran into problems. Transporting soldiers back to the their home world for the surgery and implantation was a costly venture in both time and money, without any certainty the patient arrive without interference from invading fleets appearing at will into hyperspace.
**The Old Sith Wars**

I actually planned on the history continuing, including the very harsh planet they crashed on to. After three hospital/cyborg shops were shot down and crash landed on a toxic planet, the survivors turned to cybernetics in order to survive.
But, I like what you have. Very cool.
