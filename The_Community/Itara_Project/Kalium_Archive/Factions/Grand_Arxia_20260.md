# Grand Arxia

### **Thraken** (2008-10-28 12:25:07)

**Grand Arxia**
**Type:** Democracy
**Executive:** King Seiphe James and Administrator Ramona Eathon.
**Legislative:** As above with Royal Council and Arxian Court
**Size:** Small (8)
**Wealth:** Rich
**Allies/Enemies:** Grand Arxia possesses no true allies but currently have an active deal with a consortium of Hypergate operators. Arxia is generally amicable with neighbouring powers with the exception of one former war enemy that remains somewhat insular. As a society that holds stability and justice in high esteem criminals, terrorists and other undesirables would be their enemies.
**The Force:** As a minority group possessing unusual and powerful abilities, perception of them may range from pity to outright fear. The Government established a group to study the force and support the force-sensitive in society. The practical result however is that those in normal society generally live under supervision and carry a certain stigma as if possessing a medical condition. The one place where this is kept to a minimum and live a relatively prestigious life is the Special Abilities Task Force itself that was formed.
**Law Enforcement:** 7-9 Local Governments have a wide range of services in order to support and protect the populace, however smaller colonies on other worlds have an accordingly smaller support and operational base. Anything that incites violence or hatred would warrant a call to the authorities. You are entitled one clear warning. After that it's the responding team's call.
**Starship Construction:** No names in particular come to mind atm. Technology depends on what is mechanically possible in our little world...
**Holonet Access/Strength:** Military operates a private Holonet based system of INT 20. Public access by licensed broadcasters pay fees to access the Holonet, though limited access is provided in community libraries. The strength of these private broadcasters systems varies.
**Technology Level:** Pending exploration of the possibilities.
The following are the contents of the original post. They're just notes and will have to be rewritten for this<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Overview**
A powerful and influentual government residing within the Hapes Cluster. All that is known about them comes from encounters with their dedicated patrols and their recently opened up commerce system of Lorell. Ruled by an elected King who continues his predecessor's policy of removing violence and animosity within the government as well as a high priority on the well being of his subjects. Expect any crime, disturbance, attack or disaster to face swift and harsh response from their highly professional armed forces.
**History**
[hide:23o9lhgt]Millennia ago a band of interstellar pirates - The Lorellian Corsairs - having stolen the most advanced hyperdrive technology at the time, made the most easily accessible system of the treacherous and dense star cluster their base of operations. With great ambition they also constantly expanded their operations, recruiting or abducting the most skilled workers and beautiful mates across the quadrant of the galaxy making inroads into the cluster. However, their reign of terror was not to last after a rare joint campaign by the galaxy at large led the majority of the corsairs into a trap that left none alive. Following this their base of operations - on the world of Lorell - was bombarded into oblivion. Unknown to the coalition however was that the majority of their labor force had been moved into the cluster. With no power left in them their slaves rebelled and destroyed the last of the Corsairs.
Following this time, the female majority of the population rallied around those few who were consorts of the pirate leaders and thus possessing knowledge of the cluster and worlds around them. The male population, having been mostly used for physical labour could not match this power and eventually became suppressed in a matriarchal society.
Over time the government that centred around a lone hereditary queen became increasingly corrupt and oppressive as the people explored ideas of reform. Contact with the outside galaxy and concepts of freedom and government would further accelerate this downward slide.
Hapes was eventually embroiled in a war with a coalition of its neighbours and its military leaders were shocked to discover that other galactic powers used turbolaser technology, a weapon system with far greater reach and power than most weapons Hapes fielded. Despite this the mad queen forced the military to press on with threats of torture and death, resulting in the decimation of the massive fleet that Hapes has built over time. Rear Admiral Andrew - one of the remaining flag officers remaining and certainly the last of the male flag officers - in the face of this crisis quietly polled the nobility and military. He gathered the outright support of many and passive support from the rest and thus launched a swift coup d'etat. After a fierce and intense battle with many falling to the queen's personal assasins the day was won and the nation came under temporary martial law. Now armed with total control he completely changed the tactics of the fleet with an emphasis on small unit tactics. This combined with impressive diplomacy resulted in peace settlements with many and the humiliating defeat of those who organised the coalition.
Upon attempting to restore government Admiral Andrew's overwhelming popularity as a result his feats saw him pressed into the role as head of state. The role became that of an elected king and over the course of his reign he would make many reforms to Hapes. When he chose to step down from the post he made known his favor of one of the candidates, a new and relatively young navy admiral like he was.
King James would take up the legacy left to him and complete the reforms that his predecessor began. His most recent and radical act was the developing and opening of the Lorell system to the galaxy as a trading world.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**Government and Politics**
[hide:23o9lhgt]Hapes is an elective monarchy with a popular King who was a former navy admiral. His hand picked second is Administrator Ramona, chosen for her phenomenal skill in politics. The Royal Council consists of the chosen best members of the government branches from whom a single candidate is chosen by the King and his advisors to lead each department.
Representation and local councils work in a hierarchical system. Each major world elects its own Lord who oversees the locally elected Baron of the colonies and cities under their jurisdiction. These elected people serve as representatives to the person above them in the heirarchy and are also responsible for choosing the most capable person available as governer and assisting him or her in selecting a capable staff.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**Culture**
[hide:23o9lhgt]The society outwardly appears much like any modern democratic society. Morale and popular support for the government is high - certainly a situation envied by other governments. This is in spite of being a totalitarian government that allows fewer rights compared to others. Thus the reason for the morale and popular support is that almost the entire populace live safe, peaceful lives and are able to pursue their lives without oppression thanks to the government (and by extension the King and the armed forces) efforts.
Due to their prosperity and their old nobility maxim "Society's betters should support those lesser" the nobility have always supported the lower classes, although often as demonstrations of wealth and power. While the emancipation of the people stripped all direct power from the nobility, their remaining wealth and connections still generally provide them with a somewhat priveliged position and typically throw opulent dinner parties which at their extremes may be a place to plan power plays or more commonly an occasion to meet and converse others from their level of society.
Due to the equalising of rights and the sense of superiority has evolved in the people, believing that their near perfect society and government is superior to that of all others the maxim "Society's betters should support those lesser" has become a more national attitude, producing a cooperative and helpful society. There are forums who spend their time discussing a less elitest version of this maxim, but none have gained widespread acceptance yet.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
***Economy***
[hide:23o9lhgt]The main force behind this small government's success are the rich resources of the fortress like cluster. With such great wealth to be tapped, even the most pessimistic of forecast do not envisage any shortages of much of anything in the future. With the recent opening to galactic trade Hapes has much to offer while imports are largely confined to technological and cultural goods.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**Laws**
It's laws are much like any modern democracy with some exceptions. Generally there are strict laws and procedures prohibiting anything that negatively impacts society.
**Armed Forces**
Ever since King Andrew's domination of multiple foreign powers the tendency has been towards compact and skilled. Only if Hape's enemies decide to massacre populations on city worlds will any find dense enough targets pour firepower on. And even then they would have to survive Hapes' elite forces first. Unfortunately, decades of peace in the modern more open government have led to budget cuts to this proud military.
The bottom of the chain would be the Servants. Taking the original meaning "Those who serve" these are analogous to police but also perform civil services. The average patrolman will perform police duties as well as intervene and mediate domestic or civil disturbances. Persistent cases are typically forwarded to fulltime civil services for management. Beyond the normal Servants are their response teams. These serve as true emergency forces on Hapan worlds, capable of dispatching teams appropriate to medical emergencies, disasters, crimes or other events.
Next are the Royal Armed Forces, known in affectionately as the Royal Servants. Their strict domain is to serve the government similar to how the Servants serve the people, but in practice like any other military they serve their nation as a whole whenever required. In addition to normal defense and security throughout the cluster they provide a large mobile workforce force. They are trained and equipped for peacekeeping, construction, humanitarian aid and similar activities which along with patrolling constitute the majority of their operations at this time. The RAF domain can be described as long term situations, with their combat strength and doctrine focused towards taking and defending rather than destruction. In addition to their standard forces they possess a special operations corps.
The Marines Corps represent the bulk of Hape's infantry combat strength. These units are trained primarily for assault and combat often with additional training to aid in their missions in the modern environment. Working in small units, they are sent in first to decimate or otherwise prepare targets for Hapes' needs.
The most elite force within Hapes is known as Executive Administration. Simply put, they solve Hapes' problems. Only the best from all the organisations serving the government are recruited into the organisation. With a broad array of experts and equipment available to them, they are always the first ones sent into the most difficult situations.
A group that stands out but alongside all tiers of Government forces are the SPD. The Special Powers Division. This is a quasi-military official government department that deals with force sensitives within Hapes. Lacking any previous concerted knowledge of force users, the organisation has worked to changed this since its inception near the start of King Andrew's reign. If any force sensitivity is suspected those in question are required to notify their local council thus. Eventually a member of the SPD comes to test for force sensitivity. Those found to be force sensitive are typically monitored by those around them, and are barred from official sports participation or any activity that requires face to face negotiation due to fears of unfair advantage or manipulation with their unusual powers. Intentionally or otherwise this leads towards a bias to join the SPD where their abilities may be studied and where they may serve the government - which being a military based service is regarded as a highly prestigious career.
**Foreign Affairs**
[hide:23o9lhgt]Hapes is generally on cordial terms with governments similar to themselves that emphases their subjects welfare and similar social values, however their social standpoint is often seen as arrogant. This is offset by Hapes' willingness to aid their neighbours. A great step in foreign relations was the opening of Lorell, for the first time allowing outsiders to enter Hapan space and mix with its people.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**Astrography**
[hide:23o9lhgt]The Hapes cluster is a small star cluster surrounded by dense nebulae. Hyperspace within region is often difficult and time consuming. Sometimes dangerous. Only the benefit of having resided within the cluster for millenia have Hapes overcome this and charted fast routes. The furthest star system of the cluster is Lorell, situated in a clear region of space and thus the perfect location for galactic traffic.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**Population**
[hide:23o9lhgt]Due to their history Hapes is mostly populated by unusually attractive humans as a result of their millenia old pirate origins, whose practises involved abducting the most capable - and for women, beautiful as well - young people to assimilate into their band. The humans remaining after the defeat of the Corsairs represented the largest breeding population. Currently approximately 20% of the population are of native racial minorities. Genetic manipulation is restricted and only widely permitted for correcting problems detrimental to health. Adding further to their overall fitness and health is a good understanding of those topics precisely. Millenia of regulated government has led to good study of physical and mental health and thus the government encourages health regimes for optimum physical and mental performance. Arguably the humans of the cluster could be considered the best specimins of normal humans.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**Technology**
[hide:23o9lhgt]For the most part the technology of Hapes is much like that of the galaxy at large. Notable exceptions are their successes in gravity well projector technology inspired by the stellar phenomena surrounding the cluster and their seeming mastery over blaster based arms. This however came at a high price, as they lack turbolaser technology and only developed Laser cannon level armaments a few decades ago. After nearly a century of frantic research into multiple fields of weaponry the only weapon to mature quickly enough to compete with the powerful long range turbolasers were simple railguns.[/hide:23o9lhgt]
**The Lodge**
The lodge is a catch all term for hard to find manor like buildings found on the city world of Lorell. One can only find their way to a lodge by skill; A daring pilot or a skilled scout may stumble across one on a trip, A well connected noble may hear of the place, A scoundrel may find hints of their existance through various sources or one may be guided to one by some paranormal guidance.
These are in fact places for those of skill in order to meet, exchange information and find quests. Managed by a handful of mysterious people each lodge possesses many individual rooms, a not concealed but hard to find hangar and garage, a medical room, a workshop and a main communal area where visitors meet and spend time together. Since Lorell was opened to the galaxy there are also rumours amongst lodge goers of Lodges being set up around the galaxy as well. While sufficient ability is the only prerequisite there is a definite relaxed and dignified air to the lodge, which some find much more preferable to your average starport cantina.
Lodges are staffed by a host (Diplomat TotG p35) a medic (Medic TotG p54) and a technician (Outlaw Tech TotG p62). Npcs of almost any type may be found at the lodge such as an information broker, a slicer, traders carrying equipment or any other character possessing heroic levels. These places serve as a starting point or safehouse for adventures
[hide:23o9lhgt]The Lodge is in fact a calculated initiative by Hapan intelligence to further Hapan interests in the galaxy at large. In this way intelligence is gathered, talented individuals - including experienced force adepts that Hapes are only starting to learn and take advantage of - are scouted and operations performed with no ties to Hapes. A significant portion of the transient lodgers are Hapan undercover agents who provide services for lodge members and or to safeguard the staff. As a last resort the lodges possess escape passages for lodgers, only revealed when needed and secret escape measures for the staff in true emergencies when a Lodge must be abandoned.[/hide:23o9lhgt]

Hmm, while I think that multple organizations could work well, I would suggest you do them as one organization. You could have the various benefit levels have different effect depending on what inside the government you are working with, and have certain criterias that raises your score in only one of the different areas, as well as some that increases you score in general.

I've rewritten the thing using Wookieepedia inspire section headings.
Once again I'd like to ask about names - As well as finding names for the important characters I'm still wondering about the use of the Hapes name, thus suggestions would be helpful
I've a whole bunch of ideas (not entirely original), but I've written up the lodge first in order to be generic starting point adventures - primarily those below level 10
With DarthAnthrax's recommendation I think I can cut it all down to 2-3 organisations. One or two elements may not mesh well with the others.
Any other input people?

Only a few nit pick, but I'll list some:
People who have to work hard for long hours don't take the time to scheme and plot regime changes. People who have lots of time on their hands do. Normally the wealthy and unemployed plot and scheme. This faction might be be off with lots of power plays going on, behind the scenes.
SPD sounds like force users. How large is it? Hundreds or thousands of agents, or a mere handful?
Why did the ship weapons never reach a large size? Is there something in the cluster that makes long range warfare difficult or hazardous?
An elected King...what powers does the King have while in office? It sounds like he has a lot of power, but this is regulated by the personalities of the other nobles. For example, the King may call for more troops to be put into the national army, but since he's a real jerk, the nobles are slow to shift troops from their forces, and transfer over only the problem troops to the King. Orders from the King will be obeyed, by not necessarily in the way the King wants (if he is unpopular). Am I right on thinking this way?
I donno about the super nice attitude this faction has with its neighbors. I'd rather see an example of how the Hapes (or what ever you want to call them) sending aid because of something that benefits Hapas. Such as the neighbor is, per the charter the Hapas made them sign, is required to provide military protect the outside of the cluster, or perhaps the Hapas was given a mineral rich planet, or something like that.
I'd like to see something unusal in the normal operations. Like, say the court system is really strange, with no lawyers, requires 12 people to look up the relevant laws (replacing the jury) and another dozen is required to act as witnesses to the trail. Some little detail to liven up the faction, and make it unique.
Anyhow, just some thoughts.

Ah, many apologies - my mind dried up and RL was rather unforgiving for a time. Didn't realise I had a comment on here.
First point: I suppose that's true - but they would keep it very very quiet. The overall bias is towards helpful things - so generally the wealthy gravitate towards helping charities, government, non government organisations etc.
Given the current dislike and genuine hostility towards underhanded methods and criminal behaviour, they would feel the full force of the government helped along by fellow rich people if found out.
Nonetheless I guess members of these parts of society would be fair game as bad guys.
Unemployed is a stereotypical motivator towards criminal behaviour I suppose - it'd probably be more frequent than ploys by the rich people.
SPD: I'm guessing several thousand support staff across the cluster, but only hundreds of trainees and a dozen or so adepts. Force sensitivity is as common as it is elsewhere, but regulation or training is relatively new.
Weapons: Huh, I missed a spot. Their previous military doctrine for a long while was missiles all the way for major engagements. Of course then they came up against turbolasers that could start pounding on em long before they could sprint into maximum missile range.
King: politics aren't my strong suit :P He's regulated by the Cluster wide council that elects him. That's probably not the best example as military service is a good thing in this odd little society :P
Strictly yes, as King what he says goes. Generally its accepted that one person cannot personally control everything, thus he has all the regional people handle things on their level and his own council to handle clusterwide stuff.
Too nice: Help the neighbors, hopefully they're not likely to steal and pillage you <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
It's aid work and disasters mostly. If a ship sees people in trouble they should help if they can.
If a highly populated planet suffers an pandemic or widespread starvation they would go in to help.
Its a similar notion to America and its providing aid or whatever to a stricken country.
IMO - there just doesn't seem to be that many nice people in the galaxy, why can't we have some nice people? <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
As for the last bit of creativity - that may be a bit difficult but I'll see -_-
Maybe I'll take a step back from the utopia like society and say those unemployed and wealthy people you mention are religious zealot terrorists or something.

Happens.  After all, it just happened to me; I'm just now getting back to saying some thing about your post.

I disagree here.  The wealthy are wealthy for a reason, and giving to charities doesn't help maintain one's wealth (unless its a tax break).

Usually, in most societies, yeah, the poor do more crimes.  But its all petty stuff, mostly.  B&E, scams, assault, maybe a few murders.  Because that is the limit of their area of influence.  The rich, when they do bad things, do big bad things.  And they usually have enough clot to insure that whatever bad thing they are doing is *legal* by the time they get around to doing said bad thing.  Slavery is illegal in the USA, but forcing 10 year olds in some back water 3rd world country into sweat shop locations is perfectly okay.
Also...dislike of underhanded methods.  Is this a Utopia?  Everyone trusts everyone else?  Or at least everyone is pretty straight forward?  This planet would be a scam artists wet dream.  No one else uses underhanded methods, so how do they recognize one?  Or maybe the authorities are harshly reactionary to said dishonorable practices.  "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice...there will be no twice, because once I figure out you freaking robbed me, I'll send out the Brute Squad, chase you across the known galaxy, and have you beaten so bad you'll look worse than a hutt one the worst of all bad wrinkle days."
Ya know what?  I kinda like that.  A society that prizes fair play, and brutally enforces it.  Makes a rather...violent utopia.

I like this too.  Lots of options for stories, wayward SPD adepts, and fresh recruits forced to surpass their masters.  Very nice.

Missiles.  Nice.  I like it.  Bigger ships limited by ammo capacity.  Missile boats, torpedo ships, etc.  Good and good.

Good enough for me.  Cool.

Ya know what, you're right.  Okay, I can see that.  They are nice because they know they got it good, and they feel when you got it good, you help those who don't got it good.  Good enough.

## Re: Hapes [Or insert sufficiently regal government name]

### **Thraken** (2009-01-26 19:31:19)

An amendment I'll have to paste in there at some time.
The first king around the middle of his reign did overextend himself. The programme of openness and trade throughout the cluster led to skyrocketing crime rates thanks to the immigrants and travellers and even starting impacting the younger generations. Due to this trade and immigration was restricted back down to the single world of Lorell. Of course a great deal of damage was already done.
Small communities of untrusted immigrants appeared in several cities and the trade ports of Lorell remain areas of of imported crime. Thus most branches of the military do not suffer from boredom, but in fact often rotated into active crime fighting operations.
Due to this, citizens take a more arms length approach to aid. The majority are quite happy to have government forces give aid using taxpayer money and a large proportion of the populace donate what money and supplies they are comfortable with, but most leave the actual hands on work to aid agencies and the military. Holding immigrants and refugees on sovereign worlds for example, they would be unhappy with.
And regarding the missile thing I'm not so sure anymore. I was thinking going back to conventional styled but compact and advanced ships. I don't think there was any consensus in the end over in the vehicle thread that all Kalium ships should use the ship making rules.
