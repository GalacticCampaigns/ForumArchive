Reading some of breederofpuppets posts, my question is are we actually naming governments after members? or was that a joke.
though the R.O.W.A.N i think should be our first faction to complete (nice job on the acronym breederofpuppets)

I did it as a joke, and because I was tired of coming up with new names each time I made up an organization.
Other than that, hell, I'm all for it. Sign me up as a Follower of Tru. Or perhaps an Alician Ascendant.

lol, well I think Rowan deserves a faction named after him.
Alician Ascendent is such a cool name

> lol, well I think Rowan deserves a faction named after him.

I was thinking of sticking him with a Force Tradition, actually. But, perhaps a larger force in the galaxy (*"Jedi you may be, but Imperial Star Destroyer I have"* as Yoda always says) would be more appropriate.
Force Tradition for Master Tru, and I guess for Alica as well, due to the Ascendants thing. Phoenix should be an entity, or maybe a renowned battle fleet/fighter wing.
We'll open this up. Does anyone want something to be named after them, and if so, what would you want you name assigned to? And what of other people? Got any ideas on what to name after other members of the crew?
...first person who suggests a Force Tradition to be named after me gets a lightsaber in the *freakin' eye!* Twice!

Hmmm...Force Puppets, Dark Side Breeders...oh, wait: Breeders of midichlorian puppets - B.O.M.P :
Well, if anyone wants to name a faction after me, please go ahead. Could easily see it as a smaller mercenary band and fringe group, kind of like Talon KarrdeÂ´s gang.
Speaking of it, if we starts to name organizations after people here on the boards, wouldnÂ´t it be kind of fitting if respective member created a personal NPC to head that faction?

This sounds fun <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> as long as we never forget the Tru path. If one was to forget the Tru path then the minions of Zerah would be set lose upon you, and even the hired skill of the G.R.E.E.N back mercenary corps could not save you.

You could name a faction after me . . . but I believe Vader's Fist has already been taken.

Vader`s Fist has been taken but MoDa monks has not.

Just out of curiosity, what does G.R.E.E.N means?

Too early no coffie, I did not really have a meaning behind it. Though anyone could make that up.

That has a nice ring to it. They sound like the ultimate, super-powered, Force-using rulers of the galaxy, but that's just me. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
As for the G.R.E.E.N. mercenaries? How 'bout the Galactic Restoration Endevour to End . . .? Okay, I need a word for combat that starts with N.

Neutralizers, that does not work <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

Greatly Rebuilt Elastic Exception Notaries- a legion of re-tasked droids known for their unparalleled book keeping programs!
Generally Revolting Electric Elephantiasis Nullifies- battery equipped ugly folks destroying an even uglier disease...
Gugan Relatives Executing Ewok Nuptials- er...didn't want to picture that. Sorry.
