# Cadans

As a society, are isolationist, though they will invade nearby species at times. They believe that anything less intelligent than them deserves to be enslaved, and if they find anything MORE intelligent then them they will treat them as equals, or betters, though this is a rare occurence. They occasionally trade with those explorers who happen upon the Cadans, though what they trade would have to be very valuable or rare. So Cadan technology is very rare in the Kalium galaxy. They control over a dozen planets, most of them with enslaved species, which they control with their advanced weapons. The most sought after weapons of the Cadans are their sonic weapons, as they have learned how to manufacture the very best sonic weapons. Cadans will most often bargain for information, such as the state of a planets military or economy. Cadan force sensitives are rare, though not unheard of, those that are force sensitive often become very powerful in Cadan society, and are envied by many.

I figure this thread is more for organizations, not individual species. So, perhaps call thus maybe we should gather this under another name, like the Cadan Initiative (this sounds like a [plutocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy") but I'm not sure), or something like that. Anyhow, a description of the species, systems, societies and planets that fall under the rule of Cadan, I think, would be more appropriate for this thread.
This of course, is just my thoughts.
To help out with this, I'll post a few ideas for those under Cadan rule, later, if you are interested.

Should have said that. Please do leave your orginal content up there.
Ideas for the servants of Cada:
They need a war-like race to fight for them. Everyone has big, brutish thugs, some let's do something else. How about the [Nagai](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Nagai "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Nagai") instead? Or something similar? Honor bound to the Cadans foe some long forgotten promise. Now, with such a dangerous beast as a guard dog, you'll want to keep them well few and happy, so they will be well treated. But they should have a reason to know their place as well (respectful to their masters, without rebellion.
Or perhaps, instead of a species, a society instead. I made something one the spot, earilier, that might fit. THe Reaping, a band of cybernetic and droid warriors. Our Mandalorians. Instead of being merc, they could be a society within the Cadan's control. Everyone else thinks the Cadan's pay for their service (when anyone actually finds out anything about the Cadans), but the truth is that the Cadan's *made* the Reaping. Their mercenary appearance is just a cover.
Labors are needed, and those could be several species under the control of an overseer species. More of an organization than a series of species. If that makes any sense.
Droids. What about droids? This species is the best at making anything technological, so what about droids? Are they against droids ("A *machine* with *self-will*? Are you *mad*?")? Are thy for them? I made up a mini-history about Reavers, a droid army complete with three space station, hyperspace capable, droids factories (droids making droids), and one angry self-aware "Mother Brain". THe Reavers went to war with the whole galaxy, and only fell because some one got lucky. Perhaps the Cadan's built the Reavears, an are afraid of it happening again?

I like your idea of cybernetic warriors, droids aren't very original.
I like the idea that they took a species and changed them, made them strong, and obediant.
I'd love to see your species writeup for the reaping. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

The Reaping, as I imagined them, is not an individual species, but an organization or faction on-to-itself. Kind of like the Mandalorians of Star Wars of the [French Foreign Legion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion") of reality, in the way they accept anyone and everyone who is willing to abandoned their past and embrace this new life (and of course, applicants must be able to hack it).
Honestly, I'm thrilled to write them up as a member of your Cadan (thingy...really, we need a name for this coalition). Especially if we can get others to sign on to the idea of them being our bad boy mercenaries. I'll see what I can get up by Monday.
I plan on including droids into the mix, as well. As there isn't a single standard droid, it will create a incredibly varied force multiplier, and several surprises. Imagine the R2 unit the defenders captured from their Reaping attackers. Pleased to have stopped the Reaping from destroying the battleship, the commander sees the droid's memory as an added bonus. Only when his back was turned, the droid hacked into the battleship's computer, and put it on a death flight into the nearest sun. The R2, on a escape pod rocketing away from the doomed battleship, mused on how it easy it is for a fleshy to forget that it was a Reaping soldier first and foremost, and a droid second.
Also, public image should be that of a mercenary band, and not servants of the Cadan. The Cadan's can always "hire" the Reaping, and even have a battalion on permanent contract, but they can take jobs against the Cadans, or their allies, as long as the damage is minimal and the public image reinforces the Reaping's "neutrality". Great lengths are made to insure everyone else doesn't know the Cadans made and sponsor the merc force. Call it the best kept secret in the Galaxy.

I really like that trojan R2 idea. I look forward to seeing the Reaping. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

This will have to wait a few more days. A bunch of RL stuff just hit me, and I will need a bit to fix it all.

Cadan Initiative
Created by the high standing Cadan Lord Haxan, the Cadan Initiative is dedicated to the betterment of Cadan society. Publically, the Cadan Initiative supports the poor with advanced medical care, including the development of treatment against new diseases at an affordable price. The hidden reality though is the Cadan Initiatives real purpose is to serve as a secret medical experiment group, dedicated to improving body structure, making new implants, and making bio-weapons, by experimenting on unlucky citizens, prisoners, and other rarely seen species passing by. The organization is rather small though, only having real influence on Cadasia. But the Cadan Initiative does have quite a bit of say in medical treatment policies, and also within the military, as the Cadan Initiative has made great strides in the science of â€œsuper soldiersâ€ and bioweapons.
Type Scientists
Enemies and Allies The Cadan Initiative is a secret part of the Cadan Government and because of this, it has no real enemies or friends. The drawback of its secrecy is that itâ€™s generally short on funds, and it values members who acquire supplies, cash, and test subjects. Citizens do hear rumors about medical experiments being done on citizens and prisoners, but no one has actually proven thisâ€¦.
Scale 8 (regional)
Organization Score Criteria Becoming a member of the Cadan Initiative usually means becoming part of government. Non-cadans are rarely accepted, as they are usually experimented on. There have been a few exceptions though.
Positive Criteria Organization Score Modifier
Character Level +1/2 character level
Intelligence 13 or higher +1
Trained in Treat Injury Skill +1
Has Skill focus (treat injury) +1
Trained in Mechanics Skill +1
Trained in Knowledge (life science) Skill +1
Has Cybernetic Surgery Feat +1
From Cadasia +1
Creates new cybernetic implant +2
Donates credits or supplies to the organization +1 (per 5,000 credits donated, max +5)
Has levels in Medic prestige class +1
Creates a successful warrior template through experiments +2
Creates a cure to a disease +2
Negative Criteria Organization Score Modifier
Not trained in Treat Injury Skill -1
Not trained in knowledge (life science) Skill -1
Steals from the organization -5
Provides information about organization -10
Rank Score Titles: Benefits and Duties:
0 3 or lower None
1 4-8 Assistant: The Cadan Initiative treats lower members as aides, who assist the higher level scientists by helping on experiments. When an Assistant of the Cadan Initiative aids another Cadan Initiative member on a treat injury check, he increases the bonus provided by that aid by 1.
2 9-20 Experimenter: Experimenters do most of the lower-level research, including how species react to certain implants. Experimenters may reroll and take the better result when installing cybernetic enhancements.
3 21-30 Technical Surgeon: Since a lot of the Cadan Initiative research includes enhancing soldiers with droid systems, or cybernetic implants, the more important members, Technical Surgeons, need to be skilled in both medicine and mechanics. When a Technical Surgeon builds a cybernetic implant, or droid system, it takes half the credits, and half the time to make.
4 31 and higher Master Scientist: Only the top researchers, doctors, and scientists can reach this esteemed rank. They take on the most important work, and the current Master Scientist, Detaral, is credited (within the government and organization) with creating the Reaping, cybernetically enhanced super soldiers. Master Scientists may take 20 on all treat injury and mechanics checks, even when there is a penalty for failure. Taking 20 still takes twenty times as long.

Nice job. Fluff-wise it's excellent. Crunch-wise, there are a few things, however.
1) I think the Assistant bonus should be a +2 to aid another with Treat Injury. The reason for this is that aid another bonuses always seem to come in even numbers. I don't think increasing it like this would be unbalancing at all. Actually, I think it would help balance it *more*.
2) Under Positive Criteria, I think you should have a bonus either for being of the Cadan species or being from Cadasia, not both. Since most Cadans will be from Cadasia, it just seems a little redundant.
3) Since you already can take 20 on some Mechanics checks, the text for Master Scientists should probably read, "Master Scientists can take 20 on any Mechanics or Treat Injury checks, even when there is a penalty for failure. Taking 20 still takes twenty times as long."
I think that's it. Good job!

I based the aid another bonus off the ranger benefit from the antarian rangers, who increase the bonus provided on aid another to a jedi by 1
but taken into consideration.
I think I'll get rid of the being cadan, but not being from cadasia, since this organization is based on cadasia
thanks for the feedback <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Yep, you're right. I hadn't noticed that before. Still, the aid another bonus for Antarian Rangers applies to any skill check or attack roll involving a Jedi, yours only applies to Treat Injury. It's something to think about, at least.
