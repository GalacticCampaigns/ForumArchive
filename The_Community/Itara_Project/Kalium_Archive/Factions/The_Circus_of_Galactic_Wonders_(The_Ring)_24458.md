# The Circus of Galactic Wonders (The Ring)

I realise this is not perhaps the right place to post this, but as of yet there is no subforum for organisations (aside from those with Force leanings). I can create one, but wanted to ask if people think it necessary before I did so.
Further, I should note that I'm by no means finished with this organisation. I just wanted to post what I have and get some feedback. Those members who were part of Kalium at the beginning might remember this organisation as being posted way back when (though no doubt under a different name): I just polished up the idea with a new gloss.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Kamzel Huro’s Circus of Galactic Wonders (The Ring)</span>
Even a Galaxy as fractured as Kalium needs entertainment: in fact, it has greater need than might otherwise be the case. And so, Kamzel Huro created his intergalactic circus, which has proven an extremely popular—if somewhat overpriced—diversion throughout the known worlds.
Even at the time of its founding the circus was no small enterprise. Now, as popular and profitable as it is, the circus constitutes an entire fleet of ships which speed joy and wonderment throughout the Galaxy.
And yet, there is more to the circus than its innocent and marvellous delights, for Huro is a shrewd and calculating businessman with not a shred of moral fibre. Unsuspected by anyone, the circus is the elaborate cover for what might be the most far-reaching and powerful criminal organisation in Kalium. Wherever Huro’s acts travel, the local black market sees an increase in both the sale and purchase of drugs, illegal and knock-off products, and even slaves.
Many—though by no means all—of the circus staff are uninvolved parties in such actions. They certainly may suspect that there is a darker and grittier truth to the circus than the image it presents to the Galaxy, but few look for trouble by probing further. Those staff who are more deeply intimate with the organisation’s true face, which includes the entirety of its administration, call themselves the Ring. The Ring is the truth behind the deception, and the cover under which Huro and his subordinates act. Though the Ring’s connection to the circus is well hidden, the existence of the Ring itself is suspected by certain law officers and government officials who have seen the proof with their own eyes.
Yet is there a darker truth even behind the Ring? Certain of its members, in the privacy of their clandestine meetings, whisper of Huro. Who is he really? He appears human, as evidenced by the regular communications he sends out from his hidden headquarters, but have any of them actually met him in person? And if he is human, how has he survived the four centuries of the syndicate’s existence? The answers seem inscrutable, and some of Huro’s subordinates grow every more worried as each year passes and Huro seems no less likely to fade into memory and hand over control.
**Type:** Concealed crime syndicate.
**Enemies and Allies:** On the surface, the circus has allies throughout the Galaxy. No government objects to Huro’s ships visiting their system. However, the true shape of the organisation has many enemies—chiefly rival crime groups. It is the Ring’s policy to lean on such groups heavily and force them to submit, or failing that to destroy them. All policing agencies are natural enemies to the Ring.
**Scale:** 15 (galactic region)
((The rest is being worked on!))
