# Mandalorians in the Kalium Galaxy

### **ganthet** (2008-10-08 14:49:30)

I am going to work on an idea of the a Mandalorian battle group showing up in the Kalium Galaxy.This is going to be the cause of a Hyperspace insedent that stranded them here. I was thinking of having them settle on a Outer rim planet and restart there society there. They of course ply there trade and because known for there ability as soldiers. I might have to change a few things like the Bes'kar iron and i was thinking that I might kind of do away with the Clan Idea. I am not a hunderd persent sure what i want to do yet. Maybe there will be a metal that has almost the same propertys.

I'd rather import as few organizations into the Kalium galaxy from other galaxies as possible, to be honest. I'd rather see use take an idea, such as the mando's, tweak it this way or that, and then call it ours,than to just have another group plop into this galaxy.
I am working on the Reaping, something suggested to fill the Mandolorian role in this galaxy, but since every thing needs to be voted on, the more entries we have, the better. Especially if yours is better than what everyone else puts in.

Well, I guess I was going to try to change enuff stuff to make a (kind of) an orginal idea. Like the armor, the Clan idea. Maybe making it a more sturctard government. Like each Clan having a leader and then there Mandalore as the head of state. Maybe the Clan leaders being like a council and they handle Clan bussiness and the Mandalore over see the Council. i would have to brain strom on this for a bit. I want to make them more a power then just nomads traveling from war to war.

I think I am going to scarp this idea and come up with something more orginal. Might make a new race around it.
