# Faction Sheet

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-01 14:34:17)

I figure we need something like the planet record sheets to represent the governments, to get all the important info in one place.Â  An organization doesn't always apply, so we need something else.Â  This is what I've got so far:
> <span style="font-size: 1.40em;">**Faction Name**</span>
> Basic information and anything not covered elsewhere goes here.
> **Type:** Every faction is a government and every government has a type, be it democracy, monarchy, or dictatorship. Since the types of government possible are as varied as the people who populate them, this category is very intentionally broad.
> **Executive:** This section describes who&#39;s in charge, including both their name and title, and how much power their actually wield over the faction.
> **Legislative:** This section describes who or what makes the faction&#39;s laws, whatever they may be. It also covers the some of the more specific laws currently in effect, such as &quot;all weapons are illegal within its borders&quot; to &quot;no Humans allowed.&quot;
> **Size:** The size of the organization tells us not only its physical size, but also the approximate number of systems contained within its borders. The sizes are: Tiny (contains 3 or fewer systems), Small (4-20 systems), Medium (21-50), Large (51-200), Huge (201-500).
> **Wealth:** A faction&#39;s wealth determines what they can afford along the lines of weapons and technology. This is not the wealth of the individuals within the faction, but of the faction itself. Wealth has five levels: Very Poor, Poor, Average, Rich, Very Rich. A Very Poor faction can barely afford weapons and may have to steal or find other ways to acquire ships other than buying them. A Poor faction has ships and weapons, though they aren&#39;t likely of high quality. An Average faction can build its own ships and weapons, though they rarely have any surplus. A Rich faction has the best technology available and can build all of its own equipment, and occasionally has a surplus to share with its allies. A Very Rich faction has state-of-the-art everything and often has massive stockpiles of weapons that they may very well hand out to their allies.
> **Allies/Enemies:** This sections describes the allies and enemies of the faction. Being a government, all factions have at least some enemies, though they may have few or no allies at all. Their allies are ones they may assist in times of need and their enemies are the ones that they have to worry about.
> **The Force:** Any information regarding how the faction treats Force-users, and the Force in general, goes under this heading. This is also the place to list any Force traditions associated with the faction (like the Ysanna operate out of Hutt Space). Any Force organizations the faction opposes should be placed under the Allies/Enemies heading.
> **Law Enforcement:** How tough are the police forces in the faction? This section is rated on a scale of 0-10. Zero is lawless space, with no police force, one is only minor police (as in present, but they don&#39;t do much of anything), five is capable police force but they might turn a blind eye now and again, and ten is severe, draconian law with a brutal but very effective police force. There maybe multiple numbers in this category. For example: 8 (wealthy)/1 (everyone else), This would mean that the police are very effective in protecting the wealthy, but ignore everyone else.
> **Military:** Nearly all factions have some military presence, but the strength of the military varies greatly. This section details the military from their strengths to their weaknesses. It also details how often they get involved in foreign affairs, how aggressive they are, ranking systems and hierarchy, and how much they interfere in the daily life of those living in their faction.
> **Starship Construction**: This heading is should note two things: one, the name of any starship manufacturers that work for the faction and, two, any specific technology for the faction&#39;s ships (like all ion weapons or no shields). This section should also note whether or not the faction uses hyperdrives on its ships.
> **Hypergate Access:** Not all factions have equal access to the hypergate network across the galaxy. Some have a hypergate on every world, some may have only one gate at all. Those without a gate haven&#39;t likely been discovered yet. The frequency of hypergates is noted as: Singular (one gate for the entire faction), Rare (gates at only the most important worlds), Uncommon (a good number of worlds have gates, but they still take some work to get to), Common (has gates at at least half the worlds, and never more than a week&#39;s journey away), Very Common (has gates at most worlds, but some backwater ones may not have them), or Prevalent (has a gate for every world).
> **Holonet Access/Strength:** This heading describes the faction&#39;s Holonet capabilities. This requires two pieces of information. Access is who can access the Holonet (military, government, the wealthy, public, or something unique like merchants only). Strength is the Intelligence score of the Holonet (for purposes of the Use Computer skill). Since the Holonet is linked through the Hypergate system, only those factions with hypergates have access to the Holonet.
> **Technology Level:** This heading is for any and all technological quirks of the faction (sonic weapons, shields that are vulnerable to missile attacks, no cybernetics allowed, etc.) Any special technology used by the faction is also detailed here.
> **History:** No faction was formed from nothing, and every one has a history, however brief. This heading gives a brief overview of the faction&#39;s history, dating back to their founding. Any and all major events in their history is detailed here.

I'm sure there is more to add, but I just haven't thought of it yet.Â  Suggestions are welcome.

Actually given the number of systems in the galaxy I wonder if the largest would be thousands of systems in size. Of course ones these big would be subject to Rowen's personal plans or approval.
These would probably be the best candidates to have the few ISD level ships in the Galaxy. Remember that possessing a system may not necessarily mean it's a developed system. Could just be an empty star system.

I thought about this, but I didn't know if it was too big.

True, but for most purposes, inhabited ones are the only ones that matter and so are the only ones I counted.  If it has any important resources at all, they've likely been discovered and so there's at least a small permanent population there.  If they don't have any resources, why bother counting them? 
Alternatively we could do something like this: a Tiny but Obscenely Wealthy faction could very well have over a thousand systems, but only two major inhabited ones.  They get their wealth from the majority of the systems which have no noticeable population. 
Still, I think that I should at least put in a new number for up to five hundred systems.

I added a heading for the Holonet for each faction.

I added a section on faction starships. I reposted the form here because I can't edit my old posts. And any more ideas for the sheet would be welcome.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-02-20 09:12:37)

Technological differences (different weapons, ship templates, all that).
Views on Force Users (we have enough to matter, in Kalium, right?)
Police agencies and enforcement level. Like, if the PC's wanted to break the law in the Scribed space, they need to know the the Scribed Security are well known for their brutal, and effective police force. In direct opposition to the SS, the Alician Accords Automatons is a droid based police force know to provide physical and medical assistance when not conducting police work (Triple A, and all that).
We'll have to have a scale for that. Ya know, 1 to ten, ten being super paranoid and what not, and 1 or 0 being lawless.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-20 16:55:46)

Nice ideas. I'll add them in.
Edit: Apparently, I can't edit my last post, so I'll just repost the sheet again.

Updated the sheet with more information. I'm going to put up an example in the Far Reaches Confederacy thread.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-14 12:33:28)

Are we still going with this in lieu of the Force Unleashed organisation features?

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-14 14:11:21)

This was never meant to replace organizations. Factions are the various galactic governments, while organizations are smaller groups within and without the factions. The faction write-up was so we could get a sense of the governments at a glance. We don't have a system for governments in Saga, so I made one up.
Let's use the Empire as an example. The Empire itself is a faction, while the Imperial Navy, ISB, Inquisitorious, and the Senate are all organizations within the faction.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-14 16:59:03)

I see, that's even better. More questions I'm afraid.
On size: What should we count as a system? Dominant presence or does even a small colony on one moon in the system count?
On Holonet: I wasn't aware that we had decided on a Galactic Holonet. Is this just an indicator of who has and operates Holonet technology in teh faction?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-14 17:03:32)

I think, for size purposes, we should count a system where the faction has noticeable influence, or is in control. For example, an Imperial-controlled system would be considered as such even though there might be a Rebel Cell there. Then of course, depending on what the faction is about, "noticeable influence" might vary. The Bothan Spynet or the Black Sun won´t be judged on the same qualities as the Empire or the Republic.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-14 19:25:36)

I think the Spynet and Black Sun are more organization material than faction (though you might be able to make a case for it). That sounds about right, though (at least that's how I'd prefer to do it).
As for the Holonet, I don't think we were planning on a unified Galactic Holonet, and were instead going to have each faction have some version of it. I think someone suggested the Holonet was based on the HyperRings, and I like that idea, if enough others want to go that direction with it.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-15 03:37:32)

Yeah, you are right, they are probably more of organizations, but they need to calculate size as well. The point was, that while the Empire pretty much need to be in control of a system to count under its size, I think the Spynet can count a system as long as it has agents there and a good view of what is happening in the system (since their purpose is not to be a government, but rather to gather information).

### **Avarna** (2009-10-15 19:40:16)

Okay. Your automatically assuming the faction is a government. What about large corporations like Czerka, Blastech, CEC and Incom? They might not be in control of a single system, they are certainly large enough to be considered a Factions.
Or perhaps "Faction" was simply a bad word choice when you meant "Goverments" From the start.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-15 19:49:39)

would they not be organisations?

Yeah, I'm talking about governments. I use the term faction because a) it sounds better than government, and b) that's the term that was applied to the different competing areas of space when I first got here last fall.
And those others would probably be organizations.
