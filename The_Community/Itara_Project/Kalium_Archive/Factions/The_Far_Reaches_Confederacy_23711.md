# The Far Reaches Confederacy

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-05 21:33:12)

In the very deepest part of the Outer Rim there exists a government known as the Far Reaches Confederacy.  Ruled by the Lord Emperor and the Lady Empress, the FRC is a widespread coalition of worlds, numbering in the low hundreds across seven sectors.
The people of the FRC are varied in race and personality, though they all follow the Ancestor's Creed:
*Do not give in.
Do not surrender.
Live life on your terms.*
A society that seems anti-government on the surface, the citizens of the FRC -- called Reachers -- have found a way to make their government work for them in all circumstances.  They are highly individualistic, living life as they see fit.  The government only gets involved in disputes.  As long as there are no disputes, anything is legal.
While many people then expect to find a hedonistic culture, that is really not the case.  The Creed is about living your life, and making your decisions, with no one getting in the way.  It is about staying true to yourself, no matter what others think.
This, of course, has created a haven for young men and women trying escape the life their parents have set before them, who wish to get married, but their parents do not approve, and for a myriad of other reasons.  It is often said that the FRC has the youngest population in the galaxy.  While this may or may not be true, a good deal of the population is very young.
Also, being what it is and all, quite a few people looking to escape the law find their way here, where the people are more tolerating of a few (nonviolent) offenses.  This has created a vast underground network of scum and villainy which thrives in the environment the Creed provides for it.  Black market trades occur everyday in some of the shadier locations, and it is not difficult to find a fence for anyone who is looking. 
Slavery is anathema to the Creed and its practice is forbidden in the FRC.  Still, a small slave trade has developed within its borders, by the criminals who have escaped here.  Few know of its existence -- if more did, it would not last very long.
**History**
The FRC has a history stretching back over ten thousand years.  While few people bother to learn it, it is a long fascinating history.
The FRC was originally a multi-system co-op that morphed into a multi-sector government over its history.  The original citizens banded together to fight off pirate raids and to ease trade between them.  While the Confederation began with only a loose collection of rules, those rules grew and morphed over the years until a government was needed just to manage them.
Haarak Q'Len, a Zabrak woman, was elected as Great Councilor of the Galactic Confederation by a landslide margin, winning 73% of the vote.  Her closest competitor managed only 19%.  Though Q'Len was consistently very popular, she was ineffectual and let the business interests grow out of hand.  By the time she stepped down, the Confederation was under the control of a business conglomerate.
Much of the next century was a golden age of peace for the people of the Confederation as they grew and prospered beyond any of its founders wildest dreams.  But it all came crashing down when a terrorist bombed the business conglomerate at a joint meeting of all its leaders.
The Confederation was plunged into chaos for thirty years, as everyone tried to survive the economic and societal chaos caused by the bombings.  The Confederation split into eight distinct groups and looked as if it might collapse altogether.
Then, an old archaeologist, Hanns Inatri, came across an old datacard left over from the Confederation's founding.  In it, the founder's explained their moral codes and included a motto which became known as the Ancestor's Creed.
Hanns became an instant celebrity for his work, well known throughout much of the galaxy, not just in the strife-drive Confederation.  Soon, people began to follow the Creed as a way of taking charge of their life.  A new government was formed, and the Confederation was renamed as the Far Reaches Confederacy.  Hanns was given a prominent place in the government, though he only lived for five more years.
The reorganization that took place formed the FRC much as it is known today.
Okay, that's what I've got so far.  Any ideas on how to further flesh it out would be great.  (As well as any comments on anything you don't happen to like or just seems wrong to you.)

> **Type:** Democracy
> **Executive:** The FRC is headed by Daklan Fediris, a human male in his early thirties. He got the job only because no one else wanted it. The job of the Executive in the FRC isn&#39;t much more than figurehead, serving only to make sure that disputes are handled fairly and with no other power at all.
> **Legislative:** The FRC has few laws. Those that exist do so only to prevent people from encroaching on other&#39;s freedoms. Almost anything and everything is allowed, provided no one else is hurt in the process. Laws are made by referendum and passed by a vote of the populace and any citizen over the age of fourteen is allowed to vote.
> **Size:** Small (16 systems)
> **Wealth:** Average
> **Allies/Enemies:** The FRC refuses to ally itself with any other faction, preferring to remain neutral. It does, however, have many enemies, number one among them is the Hutts, who see the Reachers as lawless and chaotic, though the FRC has, as of yet, been able to keep the Hutts out through bureaucratic red tape and military force.
> **The Force:** The FRC doesn&#39;t mind the Force as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere in people&#39;s lives.
> **Law Enforcement:** 3. While police exist, they are there only to make sure disputes do not break out into violence, and most don&#39;t really care all that much anyway.
> **Military:** The FRC does not have much in the way of a military. It uses mostly combat droids, as it doesn&#39;t want to bother its people if it can possibly be avoided. Tha being said, those droids are exceptionally proficient at what they do. Since the FRC wishes to remain neutral, the droids have never been used in combat against another faction, unless that faction has tried to invade them (like the Hutts).
> **Starship Construction**: The FRC is home to Miracle-One (M1) Spaceworks, a maker of luxury liners and personal yachts. Most of their military ships are converted liners outfitted with weapons bought elsewhere and, as such, are typically relegated to weapons with a Restricted rating or less. Because of the need to protect their passengers, M1 is known for its outstanding shield generators and have pioneered the use of multiple backup generators.
> **Hypergate Access:** Uncommon.
> **Holonet Access/Strength:** Everyone (free)/16
> **Technology Level:** The FRC is not known as the greatest designer of technology in the galaxy, and most of what it has is an amalgam of technology taken from elsewhere. Almost any kind of technology available to another faction is available to anyone in the FRC who looks hard enough. Its one area of expertise, though, is medical technology. All FRC medical technology confers a +2 skill bonus to Treat Injury to any trained uses of it, though the price remains the same. For example, a regular medpac confers a +2 bonus to attempt to treat wounds, while an FRC Fast Flesh medpac confers a +7 bonus.

Okay here's the FRC as filled out on a Faction sheet. I wasn't really sure about the bonuses I'm giving in the technology section, but I put them in mostly as an example more than anything else. So, what you think?

I like it. I'm still reading it over.
