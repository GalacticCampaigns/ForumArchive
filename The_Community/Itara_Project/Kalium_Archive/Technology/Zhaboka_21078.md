**Zhaboka**
**Type**: Exotic; **Size** : Large; **Damage**: 2d8; **Cost**: 4000; **Weight** 7.5 kg **Availability**: Rare
A traditional weapon of the Zabrak, it is incredibly difficult to wield and Zabrak spend years learning how to wield it. The Zhaboka has changed quite a bit over the years, currently it is a double bladed weapon, with the sides connected by chains, and held together in the handle in the middle. This allows the wielder of a Zhaboka to use it as a Thrown Ranged weapon using special ranges*. When being used as a Ranged weapon, it cannot be aimed, or used with rapid shot, precise shot, and sniper feat. A Zhaboka may be used to Trip or Pin a target (both as a melee and ranged weapon) without the Trip or Pin feats and may also be used to Crush or Throw the target (but they need the feats to do so). A Zhaboka is a double weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a full-round action (even when using it as a ranged weapon), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty.
*Point Blank: 1-3 squares, Short (-2 to attack): 4 squares, Medium (-5 to attack): 5 squares, Long (-10 to attack): 6 squares

thanks guys, I edited it and made it a Thrown ranged weapon when used that way(which is what I meant originally), so it can be used with mighty throw.
