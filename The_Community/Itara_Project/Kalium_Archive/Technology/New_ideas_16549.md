Weapons and armor are a specialty of mine.
One thing I've been working on are mass driver weapons (in real life they are rail guns)
I'm at school so I don't have time to post info, but I will later.
Another thing is rocket packs (like in battlefront games, with the darktroopers)
I was thinking like tripling or quadrupling the distance you jump, so if you rolled enough to jump 2 squares, you could either jump 6 or 8 squares. Combined with conditioning (and the other feat which I can't remember the name of) you could go very far jumping with this.

Remember that the rules for blaster weapons should be used as a base line (3d8 damage for a rifle, 3d6 for a pistol, etc).
Because we plan on having lots of little governments instead of one great big galaxy, we might want to think about various weapons types that do about the same damage/have the same range, but have colorful differences.  This is a sundered galaxy, after all.  Few governments would be willing to share their weapon (or any, really) technology with some one who could easily be tomorrow's enemy. 
So, the Gunar coalition have blasters as a standard weapon, while the Phoenix Alliance may use railguns as their standard weapon.  The Rodian Order Western Allied Nations (R.O.W.A.N. for short), in keeping with their peaceful, life respecting natures, tend to pack plasma shredder (compact devices that use exposure of mircoscopic amounts of plasma to create a focused explosion to launch splinters of newly superheated steel that both incinerate and flay flesh and bone).  The Followers of Tru, the leaders in living technology, equip themselves not with crude weapons, but vat grown creatures that spit acidic globs.

I like this idea, with the rules you made.  Nice and easy.  Great idea.  Maybe a limit on uses, maybe not.

you're naming is genius (Especially R.O.W.A.N <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> )
well, I meant as mass drivers as starship scale weapons, I've been trying to get them right for awhile, but it's been hard.
