# Je'kor Weapons

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-22 21:04:25)

The unique and deadly weaponry utilised by the [Je&#39;kor Mercenary Syndicate](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=43181#p43181 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=43181#p43181") is one of the reasons they are so feared.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Electrotalons</span>
**Cost:** N/A, issued to Je'kor mercenaries only.
**Damage:** 2d8
**Weight:** 1 kg
**Type:** Slashing or piercing and Energy
**Availability:** Military, Rare
**Proficiency:** Advanced melee
Electrotalons are essentially blades worn as extensions over the fingers, and can therefore be used with a surprisingly easy "unarmed" style. The blades emit bursts of electricity upon impact, from which the wielder's hand is shielded by a non-conductive glove. The electrical charge running through the talons is effective against living foes, and is also potentially deadly when employed against droids and other powered devices that could be shorted. At the wielder's option, damage from electrotalons can be treated as stun damage. Further, such damage works against droids, vehicles, and electronic devices as though it were ion damage.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Shredders</span>
A Je'kor shredder fires needle-like flechette rounds which are energised in the chamber and also contain a tiny explosive core. Though technically slugthrowers, they have damage potential equal to a blaster. Further, the unique nature of the shredder's energised rounds is of note: the ammunition's energy charge weakens a minute area of a shield it hits, making it more likely for the flechette round itself to penetrate. The effect of such a feature may not be significant when faced with a lone shredder, but when under concentrated fire from multiple Je'kor a shielded target has reason to fear. Shredder rounds treat a target's Shield Rating (if any) as being 5 points lower when determining the damage of an attack, but not for the purpose of damaging the shield itself.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Shredder Pistol</span>
**Cost:** N/A, issued to Je'kor mercenaries only.
**Damage:** 3d8
**Shots:** 50 per clip.
**Rate of Fire:** Single, Auto.
**Accuracy:** Typical
**Size:** Medium
**Weight:** 1.5 kg
**Type:** Piercing and Energy
**Availability:** Military, Rare
**Proficiency:** Pistols
The smallest variety of shredder, the pistol is still equivalent in size (and power) to a heavy blaster pistol. It is standard issue to all Je'kor, though often serves as a back-up weapon to the more pwoerful rifle.
A shredder rifle requires a flechette clip to operate. After 50 shots, the clip must be replaced.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Shredder Rifle</span>
**Cost:** N/A, issued to Je'kor mercenaries only.
**Damage:** 3d10
**Shots:** 50 per clip.
**Rate of Fire:** Single, Auto.
**Accuracy:** Typical
**Weight:** 6.5 kg
**Size:** Large
**Type:** Piercing and Energy
**Availability:** Military, Rare
**Proficiency:** Rifles
The shredder rifle is a powerful weapon that fires somewhat larger flechettes than a pistol. It is the most often seen variety of shredder and when one thinks of a "shredder" it is likely the rifle that comes to mind. It is carried by rank and file Je'kor during battles on open terrain. Because of its size, the shredder rifle is not well suited to close-quarters fighting.
A shredder rifle requires a flechette clip to operate. After 50 shots, the clip must be replaced.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Heavy Shredder</span>
**Cost:** N/A, issued to Je'kor mercenaries only.
**Damage:** 3d12
**Shots:** 50 per drum.
**Rate of Fire:** Single, Auto.
**Accuracy:** Typical
**Weight:** 13 kg
**Type:** Piercing and Energy
**Availability:** Military, Rare
**Proficiency:** Heavy Weapons
A heavy shredder is a weapon most often operated from a bunker emplacement or mounted on a vehicle. It will fire in both single fire and autofire modes, though in practice is usually only used in autofire unless carried by an individual. If you use a heavy shredder without a tripod or other mount, you cannot brace the weapon before making an autofire attack.
A heavy shredder requires a drum of flechettes to operate. After 50 shots the drum must be replaced. The heavy shredder can also be belt fed for longer use.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Shredder Flechette Clip</span>
**Cost:** 50
**Weight:** 0.4 kg
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Heavy Shredder Flechette Drum</span>
**Cost:** 150
**Weight:** 1 kg
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Heavy Shredder Flechette Belt</span>
**Cost:** 150 credits for first 50 flechettes + additional 100 credits per 50 flechettes on belt.
**Weight:** 1 kg per 50 flechettes
When belt-fed, a heavy shredder occasionally jams. If you roll a 1 when making an attack, roll the d20 again. On a roll of 1-10 the heavy shredder jams and you must spend a full-round action to clear the jam before the weapon can be used again.

Judging from your exponential mindset during the chat on prospective talents and the contents on this thread - I have this opening statement:
If I ever want anything overpowered - You'll be the first one I call ^_^
Onto the dissection!
**For all of them:** Cost. As it stands they could only exist by saying - 'these guys have them' totally unconditionally. All items have a cost associated with them for working with various systems such as considering starting credits, requisition systems, building one from scratch or by various special abilities and reference for cost value. Even lightsabers have prices on them and a special cost for building them as a force sensitive.
You need prices on them I think.
**Electrotalons**
The damage die is just about acceptable if one considers all your flavour text... But an alternate stun and ion setting?
Your note from your faction text also says they can fare well against lightsabers - are they also made out of some kind of lightsaber resistant material?
Sounds like about 3-4 templates or upgrades on a base weapon O.o
At the least these would be very expensive. Another possible restriction is that it cannot be further upgraded or modified.
A rather obscure and may not be used detail - they should probably run off an energy cell.
**Shredder Pistol**
It's a Heavy Pistol with the firepower of a Heavy blaster pistol... AND autofire AND typical accuracy AND Shield penetrating.
Again, *very* expensive and perhaps cannot be further modded in any way.
**Shredder Rifle**
Same story, it's a heavy rifle as powerful as a Heavy Blaster Rifle.. AND typical accuracy AND a bigger ammo capacity AND the shield penetratingness.
Again, *very* expensive and perhaps cannot be further modded in any way.
**Ammo**
As a reference for your ammo clips.
A slugthrower rifle clip of 20 rounds costs 40 credits and weighs 0.2kg
So your group's special smaller calibre yet high explosive shield disrupting ammo costs less than a commonly available rifle bullet?
I think it could use some work and some anti more-powerful-than-all other-gunsness.

Then let me open by saying some things of my own:
1. You clearly don't understand the concept of brainstorming. A concept doesn't have to be perfect when it's first posted, and certainly not when it's first proposed in chat. The reason for sharing ideas with others is to get constructive feedback and make them work, not to become the target of abusive comments like this one. If my design approach is to get the mechanic to match the concept and *then* to trim it back once I know the shape of the concept I need to keep intact, that is my business, and if I approach the community for assistance with doing so I would hope that they would be willing and enthuiastic partners in creation rather than treat my ideas like dirt because they aren't yet workable.
2. You have behaved rudely toward me not only here but also in chat and I don't appreciate it. If you think adding a smiley to the end of a barbed statement takes the sting away, then you are wrong. I am telling you this openly and bluntly in the hope that you will withold such antagonism in the future, as I do not wish further problems with your behaviour to fester and then become the community's problems.
3. I don't believe these weapons are particularly overpowered. Rather, they are intended to be top-end weaponry (I do agree with your point that they should be non-upgradeable because of this). They are also primarily intended to be put into the hands of an NPC group. Any Je'kor who leaves the syndicate (ie. any Je'kor PC, unless the campaign focuses entirely on the Je'kor in which case the balance issues are essentially moot) would also be stripped of any issued equipment, and would have no more access to these weapons than any other PC. Allowing a PC to acquire one would have to occur through the black market and should be a matter for the GM to decide, and in so doing they would know exactly what they are allowing into their game.

Starting credits are almost a non-issue, since only a Noble with Wealth might have a chance of acquiring such a weapon on the black market. I am not familiar with the requisition system, since it's in a sourcebook I haven't read. However, I won't dispute the point that a cost would be useful for these things. Perhaps rather than just tell me I've gone wrong and that I should fix it, you might find it worthwhile to propose a value you think appropriate?

An alternate ion and stun setting? Well, so what? Anyone can carry both a stun weapon and an ion weapon and it's a matter of a single action to switch between them. Not having to spend that action all the wielder of this weapon gains, aside from a slightly reduced carried item weight. Yes, it's a perk. But it's hardly a game-breaking one. And you know, I don't know about you but I have personally never seen either settingseffectively used in a game before in any case, since they are so much more awkward to pull off than a regular damage take-down.
They are meant to be made of lightsaber resistant material, yes. And yes, they are meant to run off energy cells. Must have forgot to add those details in my haste to post it and get it reviewed. Not being able to further modify is absolutely fine - I agree that the weapons are top end already (since that's the entire point).

Apart from the shield penetrating quality these are all upgrades possible on a normal blaster. So again, yes, it's meant to be top end and if it's given a cost that should be appropriately high. And again, yes, it's fine to limit further upgrades.

Same answer, with the added caveat that reducing the ammo capacity is fine.
One thing I realise you haven't noticed is that all of the guns are heavier than their nearest blaster equivalent. Not a major balancing factor agreed, but still worth noting. There is also room to make them heavier, since I am not settled on the values currently used.

Fair point, although I'm not sure the significance of telling me the weight since the shredder clips already weigh twice as much. +100/+150 ought to do it.

Understood and noted, I shall attempt to tone down. The 'exponential' description was a note of concern that a number of ideas seems to *increase* in power back in talent discussion.
The Mercenaries are NPCs that appear rather than players and the maxed out mods would reduce concerns.
As for costs I'd made a lot of comparisons so you might be able to eyeball equivalent values but I'll have a look.
**Electrotalons**
Sure, alternate settings may be relatively insignificant - but even those are 'more' than base. Doing such things in saga incurs higher costs and on top of that I believe your intent is to do full stun and ion damage depending on the target?
A template to add ion damage adds +10% cost or minimum 1000c. the template also requires a minimum INT of 13+ to use - pretty hefty for this ineffective extra.
It's probably a small weapon given it's mounted on the hands and are 'talons' which is 2d6. I guess your electrical charge ups the die. The advantage is that it does the damage of a medium weapon but is considered 'light' by its user.
You also wish for it to stun - which costs 1000 credits and an upgrade slot for the privilege.
You want it to do either depending on whether the target is living or droid- that's totally new and not covered in rules so I can't really say. By the rules, if it's energy (ion) you do half damage to a living target. Make it stun also - then you compare that half damage to DT and half it again to take from HP which is just not worth the bother. Your either or function if that's how it works sidesteps these limitations. Given how the weapon is said to work - maybe check out S&V Ion charger on p43 and Shockweb on p47 for their effect descriptions.
Lightsaber resistance is +20% base.
by your current setup, not sure I can place a value on it's capabilities - maybe 3-4000ish.
**The Guns**
please tell me how one can turn an inaccurate weapon into one of regular accuracy.
On damage and ammo
slug rifle - clip size is 20 weighing 0.2kg
shredder - clip size is 50 weighing 0.4kg
shredders are smaller and/or lighter despite being used in bigger more powerful guns. Are shredders mass accelerators?
Being somewhat shield disrupting would also jack up ammo costs generally as your text says it's the ammo that does it.
With all that I'm not sure where the costs would be. If they're just slugthrowers then ammo would take up a lot of the cost.
