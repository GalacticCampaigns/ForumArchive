**Sith Sword**
**Type**: Exotic; **Size** : Medium; **Damage**: 2d10; **Cost**: 4500; **Weight** 1.5 kg **Availability**: Rare
A creation of the Sith with the use of Sith Alchemy tecnniques, the sith sword is a devastating weapon in the hand of trained force users. It is a simple weapon in the hand of a non-force sensitive dealing 1d10 points of damage. Force sensitives can use it as a simple weapon, but to useits special abilities it must be wielded as an exotic weapon. Those of the sith species treat the Sith Sword as an advanced melee weapon. A Sith Sword's DR is not ignored by lightsabers, and can be treated as a lightsaber for the purpose of Block and Deflect (and any jedi talents with those as a prerequsite). Additionally, a wielder of a Sith Sword may spend a force point once per encounter to gain a bonus to damage rolls with the weapon equal to his/her dark side score. This bonus applies to the next attack made before the end of the encounter, and activating this ability increases the wielder's Dark Side Score by 1.

I donÂ´t reallt think this is necessary. You can create the exact same thing (except for the increased damage for Force Sensitives) by adding the Sith Alchemy template to a Dire Sword. Also, such a weapon can increase its damage any number of times in a given encounter, provided you have Force Points to spare.

first, I find that totally broken (every round, a sith could spend a force point, gaining easily a +14 bonus or more)
and yes, you can create a sith sword using the sith alchemy talent, but there is still a weapon called "sith sword" in the books (in threats of the galaxy)
but yes, maybe it isn't necessary. I just wanted to make something I didn't find broken
