# Unstatted Weapons of Saga Edition

### **Thraken** (2009-10-20 11:11:17)

Like my other systems thread, here I will collect together some of the weapons systems seen but aren't available in the Starship Modification system.
I'll begin with the various other torpedo weapons seen.
**Torpedoes**

A little odd balancewise, but should we create a torpedo based version of the assault concussion missile?

Maybe this could be a basis for cluster concussion missiles and the like?

kinda odd however - the text says its supposed to be ion damage but the box doesn't say so. Anyway, a line of missiles and torpedoes that does ion damage would be good.
> **Tracking device wrote:**

Maybe an upgrade or template for any launched projectile replacing the warhead.

This is all well and good. but its not enough to just list the damage of these weapon systems.
what are the costs? both price and emplacement points?

### **Thraken** (2009-10-20 15:53:12)

I'm throwing in these things from the book to generate discussion over what things we might want to include in our Starship Toolkit.
In order to refer to other existing torpedoes and missiles I might as well dump in the missiles I found...
> **Advanced Missiles wrote:**
>
> The only example is 5d10x5 and is fighter mounted. Also 10 missiles per launcher.

I'm thinking this and an 'advanced proton torpedo' could be launcher out of the existing medium launchers (well. there's only one proton launcher typeanyway)
As a ballpark - they'd take up double the space in a launcher (doesn't apply to hardpoints) and cost five times more?.
> **Super Heavy Concussion Missiles wrote:**
>
> The Mandalorians of KOTOR have a Super Heavy Concussion missile of 11d10x5.

Likewise we could have this along with the REALLY BIG proton torpedo at taking up more space and cost.
> **Interceptor Missile wrote:**
>
> the only example is 4d10x2.

I like the idea of this missile. Both on fighter scale as a more generic fighter to fighter/light ground strike weapon and on capital ships as point defense rather than using the bigger more expensive missiles. There's even a ranged weapon that's a light concussion missile launcher <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I'm guessing 1EP for a launcher and can stack 2x or more on a hardpoint?
Since you want proposals - all of that in a box...
**Interceptor Missile** 4d10x2 0 Military 200
**Advanced Concussion Missile** 5d10x5 0 Military 1500
**Super Heavy Concussion Missile** (1) 11d10x5 0 Military 10000
**Interceptor Missile Launcher** - 1 Military 1000
**Disruptor Torpedo/Missile** 7d10x2ion 0 Military 600
**Ion Pulse Torpedo/Missile** 9d10x2ion 0 Military 900
**Tracking Missile** - 0 Licensed 250
**Tracking Torpedo** - 0 Licensed 300
**Advanced Proton Torpedo** 5d10x5 0 Military 2000
**Heavy Proton Torpedo Launcher** (1) - 5 Military 30000
**Heavy Proton Torpedo (AS)**(1) 7d10x5 0 Military 1500
**Heavy Proton Torpedo (AP)**(1) 9d10x5 0 Military 2000
**Super Heavy Proton Torpedo**(1) 10d10x5 0 Military 10000
I guess I'll need to crunch the torpedo salvo later to figure out how it works...

### **Avarna** (2009-10-20 17:14:23)

well, 1 ep for a launcher across the board is simply unworkable. Even in StoG, the heavy Concussion missile Launcher is 20 EP and restricted to capital ships.
I do like the idea of the Interceptor Missiles.
I guess my vision for Kalium Galaxy Starfighters, is using external hardpoints for warheads instead of having internal launchers.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-20 17:37:38)

erm. where'd you get that from? the (1) refers to SotG tables that mean they're for Colossal (Frigate) only
that said. thanks for reminding me. I haven't got a interceptor missile launcher there.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-10-20 17:57:01)

I misread, that you were talking specifically about the intercept missile launcher.
yes, 1 Ep for the launcher is fair, and they seem small enough that 2 on a Hard Point doesn't sound unrealistic.

### **Rebaav** (2009-10-20 18:33:48)

I have a questions and ideas about the missles and I'll use conventional missle type references to provide any needed clarity (fate knows I need it sometimes).
Looking at Starfighter missles used against other Starfighters (Air to air missles lets say) I'll seperate it to 2 types for SW purposes. Furball (Short Ranged Anti Air Missles in this reality) used for short range dogfighting engagements and Standoff (Beyond Visual Range Anti Air Missles again IRL) for longer range harrassment and death. Furball are far more agile than Standoff while Standoff are faster and longer ranged.
Regarless of whether Kallium or Saga has or is going to have the 2 different range/agility types for Starfighter to Starfighter I'd assume they are a x2 damage modifier while anything directed from a Starfighter to a Capital rated target is going to be x5. Right?
Missles used to hit and eliminate a Starfighter are going to be radically different beasts than what would be used to attempt the same with a Capital ship, they move differently and are built differently so that's guidance, speed, mobility, tracking, payload, all different. Since that's a lot to parse out I'd say x2 would be much smaller than x5 for missle payload alone. Bigger boom means bigger boombox.
This would also make it easier for determining how the missles track: The x5 missles should be @ -10 to hit Starfighters (that is how the x5 guns work right?). If a Starfighter happens to get hit with one, well, there shouldn't be much left of it IMHO.
This opens up another place we could add clarity to: Torpedoes IRL have been used for anti ship exclusively in naval warfare (you hit a Mustang with a WHAT!?). I hope I've been able to provided my views clear enough so that at this point where I'm going with this is in sight. Regardless of how it's been portrayed eleswhere I understand we are making Kallium for a standard we can all use & here is a suggestion:
Missles: x2
Torpedoes: x5 (x2 EP at least for payload size vs Missles and need to be externally mounted. See Torpedo Bombers)
#d10s & +to hit vary based on tech, $, & availablility.
How's this?

### **Thraken** (2009-10-20 19:35:27)

We've had this kind of argument before with an inconclusive result.
What I am doing here is picking out the small details and filling them out in order to add them to the existing 'kit'
What am not doing is advocating a total rebuild in how missiles and torpedoes are handled under the Saga Edition game system.

I saw it as one is the same and considering a classification framework to do just that.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-20 21:22:00)

If you wish to propose an entire new set of missiles and torpedoes and maybe launchers for them please start a new thread.
I started this thread in order to discuss whether the myriad weapon systems in Saga Edition should be included and given usable stats

Wow. Far from it & I thought I was clear in my post.
> **Thraken wrote:**

Just what I was trying to do.
Visual aide it is then, very well. I was offering the idea to help organize the data especially given that the Saga stats are already organized based on x2 & x5 I just tried to work with that.
Your list could be expanded on and it seemed a bit much on it's own so I was trying to offer some assistance with organizing the data. I'm sorry if I provided something that didn't make that clear. I did mention my concern with x5 being starfighter scale and including a suggestion to treat them *like any other x5 is already treated*. I'm sorry, again, if that was unclear.
This is your list:

Any Questions?

### **Thraken** (2009-10-21 17:44:29)

None. I created that list based on the order of the weapons in table 3-5 in SotG.
First up comes the concussion type missiles, later ion weapons, I stuck in miscellania after that, then after that are the torpedo weapons. You want I should put a space between each weapon class?
And the advanced concussion missiles according to saga are fighter mountable in a launcher so I made advanced proton torpedoes the same. As far as I'm aware there are no special rules in place for x5 weapons carried by colossal and smaller craft - either x5 weapons on hardpoints, or the 5d10x5 advanced missiles that appear on fighters.

I understood.
> **Thraken wrote:**

I'll try to answer your question. If that makes it easier for you to organize the list, sure. I was suggesting the classification based on the x2 x5 differences already presented in Saga: x5 guns are bigger than x2 and act like it by having a hard time hitting targets x2 guns are designed to shoot/hit. I suggested applying that to the Missles to help with organizing what you have already & introducing new content from you and anyone else.
Having a x5 weapon track to target the same as a x2 stood out as an oddity to me. If you don't agree with treating x5 weapons any differently than x2, fine, I was just trying to help out.

I'm to understand that part of the reason the Kallium concept exists was to have a more consistant play environment than the stock GFFA offers. This would be an opportunity to do that.
I understand that you & I discussed something like this before and I don't mean to rehash anything that we already reached a conclusion on. I'm just trying to contribute to the project, perhaps I'll start a thread, as you suggested, about introducing a consistant classification system for x2 vs x5. I'll consider it, thanks for the suggestion.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-21 20:07:18)

The rule is that Capital Ships have a -20 attack penalty vs. anything less than colossal in size. The rules do not tie it to any type of damage multiplier for a weapon. They seem to be used simply as a specification of damage die rather than as a statement of the role of the weapon.
I'm not aware of any goal to have a 'more consistent play environment'. But I was under the impression that we are using the Saga Edition Roleplaying Game System.
The changes you suggest require new rules and a significant chunk of the weapons to be rewritten - or rather sections of the book to be ignored and a collection of errata written on GC.
And again. With this thread I am trying to gather the miscellaneous weapons in the Saga edition books and see if they can be added to the system. Not rebuild the system. If you wish to propose a new way of handling craft launched weapons, please do it in another thread and ask for DarthAnthrax's input as he is the manager of vehicles and technology.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-26 17:32:21)

updated proposed additional missiles and torpedoes with some blurb text.
After having looked at the the core book I realised that interceptor missiles don't really have a capital ship application given the rules. heh.

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Interceptor Missiles**
A compact variant of missile used by various planetary vehicles and some spacecraft. It possesses a blast yield comparable to that of a high energy blaster cannon and has the advantage of being more accurate at comparatively longer ranges.
**Advanced Concussion Missile**
For applications that need a much bigger bang. Using more expensive advanced parts allows for miniaturisation of the parts and a larger amount of more powerful concussion charge to be used in a standard medium concussion missile.
**Super Heavy Concussion Missile**
An extremely large and powerful missile capable of wiping out vast swathes of a planet's surface or dealing devastating blasts to even the strongest shields in the galaxy. These weapons are massive, taking up five times more space than a normal Heavy Concussion Missile. This makes it impossible to carry on Hardpoints or any small craft in a launchable state.
**Interceptor Missile Launcher**
The lightweight launch system for Interceptor missiles. It's maximum capacity is 6 missiles and may be increased in capacity in the same way as concussion missile launchers.
**Disruptor Torpedo/Missile**
A method of delivering an electromagnetic disruption charge with a standard warhead type. Missile variants are treated as light sized for use with Hardpoints and Missile Launchers.
**Ion Pulse Torpedo/Missile**
An efficient ion pulse charge mounted in a standard warhead. Missile variants are treated as medium sized for use with Hardpoints and Missile Launchers.
**Tracking Weapons**
These weapons are used in order to tag a target to make it easier to track. They provide a +5 circumstance bonus to detection by sensors on a successful hit and are often used to tag interesting landmarks such as wreckage, mineral rich asteroids or even space life forms. Bounty Hunters may use it to track ships or other vehicles however if a ship travels through hyperspace the signal goes out of range. Ships cannot be followed through hyperspace unless its jump detected and course calculated as normal. A tracking missile is normally launched from hardpoints or a light interceptor missile launcher. A light missile version costs 200 each and medium version costs 300 each.
**Advanced Proton Torpedo**
Much like the Advanced Concussion Missile this more advanced missile allows for an proton scattering warhead as large as technology can allow in a standard proton torpedo casing.
**Heavy Proton Torpedo**
*Anti Ship*
An anti ship torpedo is simply an upscaled variant of the small craft weapon. It's powerful warhead is usually capable of disrupting even the strongest shields, however it's size requires a specialised launch bay.
*Anti Planetary*
A planetary bombardment weapon designed around efficient atmospheric glide and blast waves. It suffers a -10 attack penalty when used against non planetary targets and require a Heavy Proton Torpedo Launcher to use.
**Super Heavy Proton Torpedo**
Among the most powerful weapons of the galaxy, it requires five time more space than a standard heavy proton torpedo.
**Heavy Proton Torpedo Launcher**
This system entails a large bay for all the heavy lift loading systems and the launch tube. It's maximum capacity is 20 and additional capacity may be added, increasing the cost by 25% for each additional torpedo up to a maximum of 30.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-10-26 18:13:41)

I love multiple types of missiles. This thread makes me happy.
Hey, real quick:
Why use Interceptor missiles? By all appearances they use the same to hit bonus as lasers, and do the same damage. What am I missing? Missiles now days is pretty much the fight end'er, if they hit. If that is what yer looking for, I can see the 9d10 appropriate. But 4d10 is kinda just a tease. Unless they can attack again for a few rounds (like...try to hit once a round for three rounds, until they hit or run out of fuel). But I am sure I'm missing something.
Should other missiles track? Or do more/different than just be a laser that does more damage and has a credit cost per shot?
I thought that Proton was more powerful than Concussion by a die, all the time. Not even sure if this matters.
What about ranges? "Assault" and other torps are capital ship killers; should they have anti-capital ship ranges? I'm not saying they should be turbo laser range (perfectly happy having those cannons stay the longest ranged weapons out there), but does the range they have suit their task? Are they suppose to be on dive bombers, or can we mount them on long ranged missile boats?
Anyhow, all in all, this is good.

Not a clue. It's weapon I found in the Legacy book but it's just a like any other weapon. I wanna make it a good point defense weapon for cap ships but that'd be something I made up rather than something from the book. it's a missile so has better range - maybe it's just good for popping small planetary targets that don't have shields or much hull.

As far as rules go, if it's a missile or torpedo you can lock on

Nope. The SotG book just has it as a more expensive but smaller version of the medium missile.

No specified range thus they'd use missile or torpedo range track - which is the second longest range track in Saga anyways...
