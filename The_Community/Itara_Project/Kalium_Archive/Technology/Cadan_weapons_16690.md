Cadan manufacture
Cadan weapons are made in the little known Cadan Sector of space. For unknown reasons Cadans have become skilled with making sonic and heavy weapons, starships, and even armor. Cadan items cost 40% more or 1000 credits, whichever is greater
Cadan Sonic weapons gain the accurate quality, and targets of these weapons take a -2 penalty to fort defense when hit, until the beginning of your turn. These weapons also become exotic weapons (though cadans treat them as weapons of their normal group) and are also double in weight.
Cadan Heavy Weapons can be used with the sniper shot feat, but cannot deal stun or ion damage.
Cadan armor have double the number upgrade slots, or +2 upgrade slots, whichever is less. Cadan armor requires a Dex of at least 13, otherwise you take armor check penalties, even if you are proficient.

Ought to throw in something about how the -2 doesn't stack. At least, I hope it doesn't stack, because that would be nasty. Might also mention that sonic weapons (or maybe just make sure it's known in the sonic weapon department) that sonic weapons need some kind of medium to travel through.
So sonic weapons deal normal damage or just stun?

...there are heavy weapons that do stun or ion damage? I kinda figured that once you pul out a machine gun, the point of stunning had been passed a while back.

Are there common upgrades to the Cadan armors? If there are, you might mention them. If not...cool.
