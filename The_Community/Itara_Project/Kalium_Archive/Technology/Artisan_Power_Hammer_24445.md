<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Artisan Power Hammer</span>
The power hammer is a unique weapon with a steep learning curve, though a character with the Weapon Proficiency: Power Hammers feat is considered proficient with any regardless of its size or design.
A power hammer is a mallet, mace, or maul that integrates repulsor systems into the head of the hammer to deadly effect. When pressure is exerted on the head, such as from impact with a target, the integrated repulsors activate, their energy resonating through the target and dealing additional internal damage while simultaneously forcing the weapon away making it easier to ready for another strike.
Though not necessarily exclusive to the [Artisans](http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42927#p42927 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42927#p42927"), the power hammer is a weapon initially developed by them and wielded by a significant portion of their membership. It is considered a physical symbol of their afilliation and beliefs, holding a place in their hearts and minds not dissimilar to a Jedi's lightsaber. An Artisan would not dream of wielding a power hammer made by someone else and they try to make the weapon unique to themselves, so it is impossible to categorically describe the weapon's appearance or all of its possible features. The power hammers presented here include the most common design features.

Just from a quick scan, the special ability seems a bit too much. Especially since I think it could very easily abused. And I suppose you meant the damage roll, not the attack roll?
Your proficiency listing of it does bring up another interesting question. Seeing its similarity with the FU Power Hammer, I would have listed it as a Advanced Melee weapon, but perhaps we want to be more diverse when it comes to weapon groups in Kalium? Thoughts?

Interesting. Honestly, I hadn't even realised there was an existing power hammer in the Saga books!
Probably best to use the stats presented in FU for the large version, and up the small and medium versions to 2d8 and 2d10 respectively while eliminating special ability.
With regard to the proficiencies, I had thought that such a weapon might be complex enough to be considered Exotic, and it probably would be if described the way I chose rather than the way presented in the Force Unleased. I chose to present a "Power Hammers" weapon group simply because there is more than one type, and lightsabers got a similar treatment.

I guess, my question becomes. Why does there have to be more then one type of power hammer? And why do they need the "Devastating hit" special ability?

Allow me to answer your question with another question: Why does there have to be more than one type of lightsaber?
Answer: There doesn't, of course. But Jedi are individuals and each lightsaber is unique, so of course there's going to be a great deal of variety including double sabers, short sabers, great sabers, and long-hilted sabers.
The same applies for the Artisans and their custom made power hammers.

They don't, I was merely trying to capture the internally destructive technologies involved in a flavourful mechanic. The same could be accomplished in other ways, including upping the damage dice to be consistent with the existing power hammer in Force Unleased. I'm not opposed to that, though I do think it's a lot less exciting.

While I understand that the "disrupting" feature of your hammer differs from disruptor weapons, perhaps the ability to reduce DT common in such weapons could be fitting here?

Actually, that was my first thought. The reason I chose not to was that I'd already given the Artisans a talent that lets them grant that quality to a weapon they construct. Didn't want to give them a double dip.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-18 16:50:18)

Ah, I had missed that talent.

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-18 20:24:15)

So I read the power hammer entry in Force Unleashed and thought about it. The description of the weapon in that book is functionally similar to what I was going for, with the one rather large exception that a gravity generator and a repulsorcoil accomplish exactly opposite things.
I think it's definitely best to leave the damage dice of the Artisan power hammer as smaller than the FU variety, but instead introduce a form of bleed damage ala the Teh'kla blade to represent the extensive internal damage caused by the repulsorcoil. Oh, and they need to be re-priced to more closely resemble the FU power hammer's value.
It should probably also be renamed to avoid confusion.
So, how about this?
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Artisan Repulsor Hammer</span>
An Artisan repulsor hammer is similar to the more common power hammer, but rather than integrate a gravity generator it includes a small repulsorcoil. Whenever pressure is exerted on the hammer's head the repulsorcoil activates momentarily. While a gravity generator and a repulsorcoil have precisely opposite effects, what the repulsor hammer loses in crushing impact it gains back in potentially devastating internal damage from the vibrations caused by the coil. The difference may be academic to most, but is exceedingly important to an Artisan. It is only natural to them that their symbolic weapon utilises vibrations, or in other words, "Resonance".
Though not necessarily exclusive to the [Artisans](http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42927#p42927 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42927#p42927"), the repulsor hammer is a weapon initially developed by them and wielded by a significant portion of their membership.

**Cost:** 500 credits
**Damage:** 2d4
**Weight:** 2.5 kg
**Type:** Bludgeoning and Energy
**Availability:** Rare
**Proficiency:** Advanced melee
A repulsor hammer's ability to disrupt and destroy its target's innards is fearsome. If the wielder's attack roll equals or exceeds both the target's Reflex and their Fortitude, the repulsor hammer deals an additional d4 of damage from internal rupturing at the start of their next turn.
Extra damage from the use of the Power Attack feat can be added to damage dealt to an object or a vehicle with a repulsor hammer.
A small repulsor hammer requires two energy cells to operate.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Repulsor Hammer, Medium</span>
**Cost:** 1,000 credits
**Damage:** 2d6
**Weight:** 5 kg
**Type:** Bludgeoning and Energy
**Availability:** Rare
**Proficiency:** Advanced melee
A repulsor hammer's ability to disrupt and destroy its target's innards is fearsome. If the wielder's attack roll equals or exceeds both the target's Reflex and their Fortitude, the repulsor hammer deals an additional d6 of damage from internal rupturing at the start of their next turn.
Extra damage from the use of the Power Attack feat can be added to damage dealt to an object or a vehicle with a repulsor hammer.
A medium repulsor hammer requires two energy cells to operate.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Repulsor Hammer, Large</span>
**Cost:** 1,500 credits
**Damage:** 2d8
**Weight:** 10 kg
**Type:** Bludgeoning and Energy
**Availability:** Rare
**Proficiency:** Advanced melee
A repulsor hammer's ability to disrupt and destroy its target's innards is fearsome. If the wielder's attack roll equals or exceeds both the target's Reflex and their Fortitude, the repulsor hammer deals an additional d8 of damage from internal rupturing at the start of their next turn.
Extra damage from the use of the Power Attack feat can be added to damage dealt to an object or a vehicle with a repulsor hammer.
A large repulsor hammer requires two energy cells to operate.

I think everyone's gone over the Artisans well. But still the things that don't sit well are the hammers. Given their dedication to fine craftsmanship and music I find it very odd that their weapon possesses a feature designed to particularly mash the innards of a living victim. Sounds like your Discord would be happy with the hammer though <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
I don't dispute the flavour text in using repulsor resonance and the first draft 'feature' of making the hammer easier to handle. I suppose an important detail would be how recent was the militant stage of the Artisans that they would require a people splattering weapon? Wouldn't they have tended back towards a more tool like implement over a weapon if they haven't been fighting for much of their lives?
Something more consistent with craftmanship would perhaps be precision or accuracy improvements (e.g. for chiselling type work) or a Damage Reduction ignoring effect (e.g. working on hard materials)
I don't think I understand what you mean by adding the damage from power attack - as written doesn't it work as normal?
As for the extra penalties from 'multiple attacks' if you do go with the repulsor technologies making it a more precise tool I don't think you need to make it unwieldy.

Even a person dedicate to making things knows that sometimes things need to be unmade, and once an otherwise peaceful person decides they have to fight even they recognise the need to end things swiftly. Once the decision has been made to take up arms, does the nature of the weapon even matter any more? Either way someone is going to end up maimed or dead.
Besides, the Artisans are as you say dedicated to fine craftsmanship. So if they decide to build a weapon, isn't it logical that they'd build a very effective one? Their pride would demand it.

Admittedly, the original reason for them to take up arms is quite far back in history. However, they still have a need to defend themselves. I didn't have any spare room in the profile to put everything I wanted or needed to say in, and one of those things is an important and relevant point - people want to use the Artisans and their abilities. Often, those are bad people (criminals, the Sith, and such). Even when they're not, they usually want the Artisan's aid in a cause of some kind, and the Artisans are adamant about remaining neutral. Individual Artisans coming to blows with aggressive recruiters is a fairly common result of the tradition's stance.

You know, I wondered about that too. I lifted that paragraph directly from the power hammer entry in Force Unleashed. I assumed that being unable to apply power attack against objects or vehicles had been errata'd in or something, but I just checked and it doesn't seem to have been. Unless it's hidden away somewhere I missed. Anyone know?
As for the penalties, you may be right. I wanted to balance it as well as I could with the power hammer, which also has those penalties. A substantial increase in cost or similar penalties applied elsewhere are about the only other balancing factor available. Thoughts?

Hmm.... semi. I get that the hammer is symbolic/ceremonial for them - but as an "effective" weapon...
A Hammer? Really?
At least the Jedi deflect blaster bolts with their super cutting torch/ceremonal sword. I hereby poke ur other thread.

What a trivial and most people would ignore detail. It indeed does says in the the core book that you can't use it on objects or vehicles.

Well. It's already two damage die below the power hammer. You really need to keep it unwieldy?
personally I don't think a d4 for defeating fortitude defense is actually that much.

Heh. I more meant that it would a matter of pride for them to build an effective hammer, not necessarily that it would need to be the best killstick on the market. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Wow, well there you go. I even missed that rule when *looking* for that rule.

Yeah, you're right. Now I think it through I've definitely overcompensated in the wrong direction there. I expect I'll edit the penalties out of the final version.
