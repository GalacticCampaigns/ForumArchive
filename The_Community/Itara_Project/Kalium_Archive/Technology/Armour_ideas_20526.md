My mind seems to be vomiting material nonstop on the lines of my own little government, lets put out something different and interesting. For my first idea, here be a type of powered armour/vehicle that the elite group in my government (Still provisionally named Hapes) might wield when needed. Requirements to use/fly this thing are a little in the air in my mind atm...

this should be made as a vehicle as opposed to a droid btw. one of the problems with making it a droid is it takes too many special rules, but vehicles need only about half the rules a droid would need.
**Mechanised Armoured Walker** 
Large Ground Vehicle (walker)
**Init**  +7; Senses Perception +5 or +7 with sensors
**Defenses** Ref 16 (Flat footed 13 ) Fort 15; +3 armor

Hm, I used droids so that I could tape on all the character scale accessories. Things would get a lot more nebulous, or more like best guess for starship rules

well, if the vehicle offers total cover, than it probably has life support. vehicles are automatically assumed to have some kind of communication
and I forgot to post skill modifiers. which solves the sensor package
