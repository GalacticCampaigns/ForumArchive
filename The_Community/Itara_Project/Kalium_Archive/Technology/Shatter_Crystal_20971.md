# Shatter Crystal

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 13:31:28)

Here's my first attempt at creating some equipment. I had no idea what I was doing, but I hope it works.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Shatter Crystal</span>**
Shatter Crystal is a unique crystal that can only be found on the Togruta homeworld of Tinn. It has a strange quality in that the crystal is explosive. If the right vibrations are applied to it, the crystal will explode the next time it comes into contact with any surface. If the vibrations are strong enough, the crystal can even explode spontaneously.
Mining the crystal from Tinnâ€™s caves is very difficult, and the Togruta are the only ones who know how to do so reliably. Offworld mining corporations often make use of Togruta labor to mine the crystal, which is then shipped off world for manufacturing.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">New Feat - Weapon Proficiency (Crystal Weapons)</span>**
You are now proficient with all weapons crafted from Shatter Crystal.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">The Crystalbow</span>**
Crystalbow is actually a misnomer. The bow itself is made of wood, itâ€™s the hollow arrowheads that are made of the Shatter Crystal. Before the arrow is fired, the archer taps the arrowhead with his fingernail, letting it vibrate. When the arrow hits its target, it explodes, potentially dealing a massive amount of damage.
The arrowheads are hollow, allowing the archer to fill it with various substances, from explosive flash powder to the sticky sap of the harlow tree. When found offworld, other more exotic substances are sometimes found inside.
While the bow is easy enough to make (DC 10), the arrows are especially difficult to build, requiring a DC 25 Mechanics check. Every Togruta must make the bow before he or she can be declared a full adult, though the arrows are usually provided by an experienced craftsman. The crystalbow is not available offworld, except on the black market.
The bow can be nocked with up to three arrows at a time, allowing the archer to use Double or Triple Attack with it. However, the targets must be adjacent to each other in order to use the feats. Anyone proficient with the weapon can draw and nock up to three arrows as a single move action (a swift action with Quick Draw).
The string is also very difficult to draw back, requiring at least a Strength of 13. However, the force needed to do so adds a little extra power to the arrows, allowing the archer to double his Strength bonus to the damage.
**Type:** Simple; **Damage:** 1d6, **Cost:** 750; **Availability:** Rare; Accurate Weapon
**Standard Arrowheads:** These are the standard explosive arrows for the crystalbow. **Type:** Crystal; **Damage:** 2d8; **Cost:** 75 for 10
**Flash Powder Arrowheads:** When these arrows explode, they create a bright but brief flash of light that causes blindness in the target and anyone within a 1-square splash radius for 1 round, as long as it also exceeds their Fortitude Defense. **Type:** Crystal; **Damage:** 2d8; **Cost:** 150 for 10
**Harlow Sap Arrowheads:** Harlow sap is very common on Tinn. If the attack exceeds the target's Reflex Defense by 5 or more, it slows the targetâ€™s speed by 2 squares for 1d4 rounds. **Type:** Crystal; **Damage:** 2d8; **Cost:** 125 for 10.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Crystal Grenade</span>**
The crystal grenade is a relatively uncommon weapon, but one that offworlders are most often interested in. The grenade is a hollow spheroid filled with an explosive liquid that the Togruta refer to as Blast Water. When the grenade explodes, it throws the Blast Water across a large area, as it ignites into a ball of flame. If the attack roll exceeds the Reflex Defense of anyone within the burst radius, they catch on fire and continue to take 2d6 damage each round until the fire is put out.
**Type:** Crystal; **Damage:** 4d6; **Burst Radius:** 2-square-by-2-square, **Cost:** 350
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Crystal Dart</span>**
An exotic type of crystal weapon, the crystal dart is a narrow weapon usually blown from a blowgun. They are generally used when stealth is important or the crystalbow would be too unwieldly. Crystal darts can easily be disguised as jewelry, but most Togruta would recognize them on sight, making it impossible to fool them.
**Type:** Crystal; **Damage:** 2d4; **Cost:** 150 for 10

pretty good, pretty good.
the blind effect might be a little too good though

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 13:59:43)

I agree on the blinding effect. You could make it last only 1 round on success, but have it affect everyone in a small area. ThatÂ´s usually my standard solution for brief, intense lightflashes.
I donÂ´t know if IÂ´d actually make this a weapon. I donÂ´t see anything here requiring a separate weapon. IÂ´d probably just use a regular bow weapon, and have it be he arrows that are special, since thatÂ´s they way it seems to me.
Likewise, it seems a little heavy to require an exotic weapon proficiency to use the grenade. Just make it a little more expensive and you should be good to go.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 14:11:32)

I think it's fine to have the bow as an exotic weapon, but I agree that the grenade should be simple.
The crystal bow deals an irregular amount of damage, and has special effects, which to me says it should be a different weapon (also to save GM's the bookkeepping)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 14:26:12)

My point is that does any of the special things that differentiates the bow from a regular bow come from the weapon itself or the ammunition that is fired?
If the answer is yes, then I would probably consider having the bow be an exotic weapon. If no, then IÂ´d just have it be a regular bow, with special ammunition, and atribute the additional damage to the arrows as well. The increased threat range I think is too much.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 14:32:57)

maybe make the bow made of exotic materials, and DA's right, the threat range is too good.
so give the blind effect splash 1 (so it affects everyone around the target if it hits)

---

Exactly. As it was described it was made of wood and was very simple to made, so I can see no reason to have it be any different than a regular bow.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 14:54:16)

well, modavader can easily change it, it's his creation
oh yeah, I posted the Kel Dor species, with some changes, go check it out <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 16:33:31)

Okay, I didn't really know what do do about the blindness, so I'll go ahead and change that. Thanks for the help. Also, I have no idea what I was thinking with the extended crit range. Yeah, that's too much.
As for the bow, yeah, it doesn't look like much more than a regular bow. That's because I forgot to add some of the mechanics in when I posted it. Oops.
The grenade is an exotic weapon because it requires a knowledge of the vibrations in order to use correctly. Vibrate it too little, and it may not explode for a long, long time. Vibrate it too much, and it could explode in your hands.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 16:39:03)

your bow and ammo should cost much more now. It's much more powerful. but it looks good.
hey, do you want to look at my Kel Dor and Bendu stuff?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 16:46:46)

Yeah, I wasn't so sure about the prices. How much do you think they should cost? I originally had 1000 credits for the bow, but I thought that was way too much. I think the special arrows were also originally 200 for ten, but I dropped that price, again because I though it was too much.
Oh, yeah, I did look at the Kel Dor. Nice job. I'll take a look at the Bendu soon.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 16:50:02)

I would say 750 credits for the bow (and it's availibility is rare, and so costs double on any other planet that it's not made on)
and ammo, maybe 75 credits for 10 arrows (based off of the rail detonators gun ammo costs)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 17:10:39)

Okay, thanks.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 17:21:19)

Nice job! and you quickly fixed the biggest thing I noticed (and I don't usually catch that sort of thing), the blindness.
Good job guys! Awesome weapon.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 17:43:15)

Hmm, sorry, but I still donÂ´t see the bow itself as an exotic weapon. It seems to function just like a regular bow. Well, maybe a compostite longbow, but still a bow.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 17:45:06)

it does have different rules than a normal bow (he edited it)
it requires some different things now.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 17:49:59)

I think I know where you're coming from DA. It may do some different things, but its still basically a bow, right?
Well, it can easily hold those three arrows it can fire, which I think makes it unique enough for an exotic weapon.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 17:57:04)

Well, maybe its just me then, but I think you can nock three arrows on a normal bow.
IÂ´ve read somewhere that the criteria used to determine if something classifies as an exotic weapon is if it is different enough in the way it is wielded.
The only difference I see id that it is made to easily hold three arrows at once. However, if you only wants to fire one arrow at once? is it then any different from a bow?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 18:09:26)

According to the core rulebook,you can only nock one arrow at a time, and you can reload it as a free action. Neither is the case with the crystalbow. Still, I could see it just being just a different type of bow.
However, the arrow could not be. They require a special knowledge to use correctly -- knowing what vibrations to use. Calling the arrow an exotic weapon just doesn't seem right; I mean, what ammo is called exotic when its weapon is not?
Still, using the crystalbow with regular arrows is not out of the question, and neither is using crystal arrows with a regular bow. So, then, maybe the arrows should be exotic, but not the bow?
I'll have to think about it.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 19:52:41)

It has to be different in the way its wielded, eh? That could be solved by requiring it to be used with a bracer. This bracer anchors the bow to the users arm.
Hey at least its something to possibly go on, I got a fever and weird things come up when I do lol. I'm not sure the purpose for a bracer but if any of you could make that work would it qualify as an exotic weapon then?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 21:08:15)

Hey, that could work, too; I hadn't thought of that. Nice idea, Rowen. I'll have to give it some thought.

Rules-wise you might only be able to nock a single arrow, but physically you can probably rack up an entire quiver at the same time on the bow. Not that you could really expect to fire it though.
IÂ´m not sure if the rules actually restricts using Double/Triple Attack with a bow, but in my games IÂ´d always let it go. ItÂ´s not like Double Atack(Simple Weapons) would be overpowered in any way.
What I was trying to point out was, is it in any way different from a bow? Is it something more than a wooden piece bent by a string? If not, IÂ´d say keep it as a regular bow, perhaps let it be an "accurate" weapon, if it can fire further.
Having the arrows be an exotic weapon also sounds a little bit bad, but I have another idea. How about a Weapon Group Proficiency(Crystalline Weapons/Shatter Crystal Weapons/Whatever)? This could include using the special arrows, the grenade, and possibly more weapons.
Just a thought.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 12:48:11)

That's actually a very good idea. Once someone knows how to vibrate the crystal, they can do the same for all crystal weapons then, instead of having to take a separate feat for each.
Here's what I think I'll do. I'll make a new weapon category for crystal weapons, which will include the arrows and grenades, as well as the new crystal dart I came up with last night. This allows us to add new weapons to it in the future.
Second, the bow will remain a simple weapon, just as a new type of bow. Lastly, the Togruta will just get a weapon proficiency with crystal weapons as a bonus feat instead of Weapon Familiarity.
How does that sound?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-12 13:55:11)

Sounds good to me.

*"If the right vibrations are applied to it, the crystal will explode the next time it comes into contact with any surface. If the vibrations are strong enough, the crystal can even explode spontaneously."*
This line in the description presents a major draw back to me. If I were a person who was knowledgeable in the Shatter Crystals unique ignition system, couldn't I simply make a Sonic weapon that can make the frequency and use it to set off the ammuniton and grenades carried by an enemy?
This is a very cool idea and I hope I missed something that makes this entire post irrelevant.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-13 10:31:19)

Actually, sonic weapons are supposed to be very dangerous against them. However, only a few cultures actually use sonic weapons. The general idea was that every culture would have a unique weapon that would be very effective against some and almost useless against others. At least, that's how I understood it.
But, yeah, someone who was proficient with crystal weapons and can build sonic weapons *could* do it. However, normal sonic weapons wouldn't operate at a frequency that's particularly damaging.
