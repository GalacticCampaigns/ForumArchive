Size: Medium
Damage: 2d8
Weight: .7 kg
Type: Slashing or Piercing
Available: Rare
Proficiency: Advanced Melee Weapons
The Nichet Crystal Blade is the signature weapon of the Runes, the Force using Royal Guard of Nichet. Its also the weapon most often associated with the planets tradition of dueling.
The crystal used to make the blade of the weapon is unique to Nichet, and is clear when harvested, and as part of the refining process will take on any number of colors. Common colors are often on the cooler side of the color wheel (Blue, Green, violet) While the Warm colors (red, orange, yellow) are rarer and highly prized. The hilt is often modified to suit the taste of the wielder.
Do to the unique nature of the crystal, Lightsaber don't ignore a Crystal Blades DR.

What size is this weapon? IÂ´m guessing something longsword-like (Medium size), but it could be kind of cool with a set of witches (or something) that wields smaller, knife-like blades. Of course there could be variants.

Yes, Its medium. I've edited the above entry to reflect that.
The Rune's aren't witches like the Witches of Dathmir, their more of a force of elite bodyguards.

Yeah, I guessed. "Witch" just happened to be the first synonym for "Female mystic" I could think of.

I have a question about this weapon: what properties does the Nichet crystal possess that makes a sword composed of it have equal damage potential equal to a lightsaber?
Let me clarify that I have no problems with the weapon having 2d8 damage, I'd just like to see some justification in its description.

it has to do with the refining process that gives the crystal blade its color. You'll understand if I can't give you details, as that would work counter to mystical nature of the weapon.

New guy here... I know im jumping in WAY late on this one, but im with simply on this one.
Blade would be AWESOME for a powerful melee character to wield, but it just seems a bit excessive for the description given.
Take a Lightsaber for instance; nothing really mystical rite (hope I dont hurt any force-users feelings with that comment =P) the crystal itself is used through technology to create the blade. The properties in the crystal may be mystical (not sure on that...), but the process to achieve the actual weapon is through technology.
If the wielder if your Blade has knowledge enough to obtain (whether through purchase or crafting,etc.) wouldnt it be logical that wielders would have knowledge of the "refining process?" So, using logic of "physical element with mystical properties being refined through technology to create the physical element with enhanced mystical properties"
The science is what draws us to love SW universe. the love for SW universe comes also from this fact this: a dragon didnt piss on my sword to give it +1 on ATK rolls. (at least thats why I like SW)
Dont misunderstand; if I had a Blade like that for a strong melee fighter... I would rival the Lightsaber wielders!
Maybe I was a bit excessive with my critique, a 2d6 would seem more plausible.
I give it an 8 / 10
