# 'Other' ship systems

### **Thraken** (2009-10-16 17:27:02)

Originally I was gonna post a cumulative list of possible technologies found in the books that could be properly made into systems for use with starship modifications. However that was a *very* long list. So I'll only posting segments to discuss atm.
Firstly, the recommendation that I quoted in the errata thread
> Here&#39;s another good rule of thumb: If you want to do something usual with a system &ndash; make it concealed, make it hold something it wouldn&#39;t normally hold, make it modular (i.e. so you can swap out a weapon mount quickly instead of as a modifcation), or whatever &ndash; the simplest way to handle it is to charge 2 x EP and 5 x cost, similar to a nonstandard modification (but the Starship Designer feat won&#39;t bypass the extra cost). For example, a quad medium laser cannon costs 2 EP and 20,000 cr, and a retractable quad medium laser cannons would cost 4 EP and 100,000 cr.

Given that there may be allsorts we might want to do with our ships, should we accept this as a guideline for adding certain systems with extra features for at least draft format vehicle sheets?

It's weaker than a jamming suite, but affects all adjacent ships. Would it be worth adding this?

Possibly a template on the Shield table. SR not reduced by any single attack unless autofire or 'stutterfire'. Can be used as a weapon to attack SR only of other ships reducing SR by 10 if successful, can be used as tractor beam. Can choose +2 movement speed, +20% SR or +1 die Dovin Basal damage.
Maybe a version could be used as a multipurpose system?

there's already a character scale version, but a vehicle mounted one makes more sense.

It's an interesting idea. overcharged strong shields but don't have much endurance. could make a template for this. rough calculations indicate it could either give a shield a x2 strength modifier (if the shuttle would have had SR 115) or a x5 strength modifier (if the shuttle normally had approximately SR 45)

Sounds useful

A more dedicated stealth system than sensor baffling and less so than a cloaking device
> **Shield Energy Drain wrote:**
>
> A Kedalbe system. Drains adjacent ships shields by 10 per round for 5 rounds and for every ship drained gains +1 to energy weapon damage up to a max of +5.
Sounds kinda complicated to me, but could be used as basis for other 'draining' ideas?

I think it sounds like an okay way to treat such things.
If you want to add any new ship system to the Kalium Galaxy, then please use the "Weapons and Armor" section of the Kalium forum. I´ll PM Alicia to see if we can change it to the more appropriate "Technology" title. I´d like this section to be for vehicles only.

Thanks for the move,
There are 8 possible pieces of other tech to be discussed, not counting all the minor skill bonuses, penalties and such listed in flavour text.
I'll open the floor with the two defensive techs.

Tbh it makes more sense for an air or spacecraft to have one. However capital ships should be restricted from these to avoid them becoming even more unmanageable for little people...
I suggest something like: 1EP base and double for each size class above Huge. +5 equipment bonus to reflex defense vs. guided weapons for Colossal or smaller ships. +2 for Colossal (frigate) or larger.

It's an interesting idea. overcharged strong shields but don't have much endurance. could make a template for this. rough calculations indicate it could either give a shield a x2 shield modifier (if the shuttle would have had SR115) or a x5 shieldmodifier (if the shuttle normally had approximately SR45)
**Template: Overcharged Shields**
*SR is multiplied by 5. Any damage reduced by SR reduces SR by 5 even if the damage does not exceed SR. If any damage exceeds the SR it is reduced to 0. This template applies to a manufactured shield system.*
If I understand shields right, this probably has most benefit for smaller ships with the smaller shields. Some may choose to be limited by a certain type of shield technology. Last suggestion of the post:
**Template: Reconfigurable Shields**
*Increase EP cost by 2 and base cost by 3 times. The System Operator may choose to switch between normal shields and Overcharged shields with three swift actions and a DC20 Mechanics Check (as if recharging shields). If this check is failed by 5 or more the SR is reduced to 0.*

I looked over the stats there. Looks neat.
For me though I'd have a lot of these things abstracted. I'd assume, for example, that military vehicles would, for example, have ECM & ECCM by default abstracted into their base stats. It's not standard on a person so that's what I'd expect is a seperate item for a person/charcter.
For those overcharged sheilds though... I seem to recall something about an Imperial Assault shuttle having something like that?

That's true - Armor bonuses on paper can vary wildly and look far too heavy for a given ship...

Erm. yes that's where it's from.
That's the object of this thread, find the particularly tangible abilities seen in the books but aren't listed as a system usable with the Starship Modification rules and adapt them :P

Whoops, my fault. I missed part of my post. <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: -->
The rest of it was that this, and ablative armour, would be great for small ships like fighters and I think was the concept behind the Imperial Assault shuttle and the Defiant from ST:DS9.
A fighter with ablative armour would have, say, +10 or +15 on its DR. Should that ever get penetrated it drops by 5. Combine that with the Shields and you've got great lightweight assault fighters.
I've always liked "Death Spiral" in game systems. Stuff/people get damaged/hurt it **ACTS** damaged/hurt.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-19 18:06:23)

Considering the mechanics of ablative armour I don't think something as small as a fighter could mount it :P Unless you're going for the Suncrusher or something.
And isn't that what the condition track is for? :P

No that was McGuffin armour. Not the same thing at all <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
> **Thraken wrote:**

Nope. That is the point behind it entirely. The armour is designed not to absorb damage but to sacrifice itself to take the damage that otherwise would have penetrated (condition track) to the target. The idea is then now there is less armour to protect you but you are otherwise still ok, hence the DR reduction. DR that works just like SR.
That was why it was packed onto the Defiant in ST:DS9. It was the small ship answer to big ship armour.
When I saw the SR mechanic for the 1st time in Saga I eagerly looked for it as the explanation for Armour in DnD4.0 as I saw it as an elegant, wonderful mechanic for just that purpose.
It not being included was the 1st disapointment I had with DnD4.0...

1: still wouldn't fit on a fighter :P
The defiant was frigate sized and has fewer decks than other ships of it's size so it could have several feet of ablative armour :P
2: I was referring to your 'death spiral' - Condition tracks also reduce reflex defense, fort def, etc etc.
Anyway. Digression much?
**ECM seems fine to drop
Any other people have more to say on the alternate shields?
And two more systems from my list up there**

Found in the Legacy book on one of the GA frigates. I think this would be good, complimenting or replacing the general purpose sensor enhancement in some places.
I'm thinking something around 5 EPs for this?
> **Stealth Technology wrote:**

Also from Legacy, a more dedicated stealth system than sensor baffling and less so than a cloaking device. This is different from sensor baffling as that allows you to move in a stealthy way, whereas this is more like real world stealth technology as the thing is built to be hard to detect.
I'm thinking nonstandandard unless you have a starship designer, triple base cost if not included in manufacture, probably Military grade, about 2 EPs?
Note that this stealth tech represents both sensor resisting tech and visual defeating paintwork - perhaps half EPs and cost for just one element?

Made it crazy tough in the short term and with the weapons it carried short term was fine. Supposedly it lacked the endurance of the larger ships.

Right. That doesn't allow for further damage to happen easier does it? I'm afraid it's been some time since I've reviewed the rules.
