Basically hand held rail guns that fling tiny metal, plastic, or ceramic beads at the target, leaving a tiny smoke streams behind for visual effect. For more fun, they could be super cold, and when strike a bulk head, leave a small ice patch. Rules for HV weapons could be the same as blasters (Blaster rifle becomes HV rifle) without a hitch. Alternate ammo would be available, such as Stun ammo (instead of a setting), and we could create rules for armor piercing ammo, man stopper ammo, explosive rounds, etc.

Tah, dah, a possible replacement for the lightsabers. The only rule change would be the weight.

Now every strike with the weapon carried a heft electric shock that is advertised to fry the nose hairs off a bantha at fifty paces. Same rules for vibro weaponry, but now you can have non-bladed weaponry deal the extra damage.

While I do like the concepts of HV-weapons and the Electro weapons, I am not at all thrilled about the Crystal Blades. I like the idea, but having them electrified and vibrating? Able to cut through anything? Heck, if we are going to do away with lightsabers, why not do so for real?
Perhaps simple, non-powered melee weapons could be the standard for close combat? Metal blades, various blunt weapons, and martial arts. With this, there could exist more "primitive species", who perhaps donÂ´t have very advanced technology, but who are strong, and skilled in melee combat. They could then still be a serious threat to more "advanced" species (who donÂ´t have acess to technically advanced melee weapons that would still leave them superior), provided they use proper tactics.
And for those beings sensitive to the Force, you could have them forge their own blades, from a specific "force sensitive" crystal, allowing them to create a personal weapon that responds to them.
Oh, and also of course: Plasma Weapons : Extremely powerful, especially in Veichular Combat, where they can eat through DR an armor.

I like that it would allow for a wider variety of "force" traditions. Unarmed monks being one possibility using the "force" as a tangible blunt force to defend themselves (picturing a martial arts monk blocking blaster bolts and hammering opponents with his bare fists, which are surrounded in a blue glow.)
Though I wonder what everyone has against jedi and their lightsabers? The lightsaber is a symbol of starwars. We should ask ourselves are we building a starwars game setting or another sci-fi setting to be added to the multitude of other settings but using the saga rules?

Indeed, lightsabers have their place in Star Wars, and since we decided to keep Jedi (we did that, didnÂ´t we?), why not leave the sabers in their hands. And of course, tha hands of anyone who can get their hands on one.

I think we did agree to have jedi in this galaxy, though perhaps on a small scale.

I like rail guns. As far as weapons go, they're more fun than blasters and look cooler, too.

Instead of being super cold, the weapons could just fling ice particles around. Shoot them with snowflakes -- or hail stones, more likely.

I like this idea. Wouldn't, though, a Force sensitive crystal have to be alive? It could be a unique form of bio-technology. Though, using a creature as a personal weapon seems vaguely dark side to me.

Well, the crystals wouldnÂ´t be alive as such. With "Force Sensitive", I just meant the kind of crystals that are normally used for lightsabers, that resonates in the Force and that can be attuned to the wielder.

Yeah, that occurred to me after I posted. However, living swords aren't such a bad idea, IMO, so I didn't change it.

While physics has never had much importance in star wars <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
it's impossible for a rail gun to shoot something cold and still have it cold, at least in atmosphere, as friction would heat up the projectile.
Space of course, it could be done, but what kind of benefit would that bring?

You have to ask?
No, but seriously, I am not- at least, not any more- proposing we get rid of lightsabers. They have their cool value. Right now, a CIV could easily be used as another Force Tradition's favored weapon. The Jedi have lightsabers, the Sith use a CIV (also called a Sith Sword), the Bendu sages use their fists (awesome image, by the way), the Jensaarai wield truly living spears, the Ysanna forgo melee weapons in favor of slug throwers (using their trademark force powers to send bullets around corners) and the Witches of Dathomir choose not to bond with particular weapons, instead relying solely on the Force when it comes to battle (picture cones of fire and ice instead of just Force Lighting).
> We should ask ourselves are we building a starwars game setting or another sci-fi setting to be added to the multitude of other settings but using the saga rules?

I thought we were building a setting with the feel and flow of Star Wars, but not a carbon copy. It maybe just me, but I see this as an opportunity not only to make a setting, but to adjust/fix the Star Wars setting so it better fits what we want/expect. The George Lucas researched stuff poorly, yet churned out an awesome set of movies. The Expanded Universe writers wrote engaging books...that conflicted each other, lacked common sense (hey, these aliens are all about living thingsand anti-droid...but don't show up in the Force...and they restirct new things while focused on evolution...and they and originality (*oh look! Another super weapon*!), used poor plot devices (*oh no, you might fall to the darkside…just like the main characters in the last three books!*), and beat dead horses until they were resurrected (*the evil Emperor, his clone, his other clone, now his ghost, etc*).
So...yeah. Let's keep lightsabers, but not the stupid parts of Star Wars.

Rapid delivery ice cubes!
