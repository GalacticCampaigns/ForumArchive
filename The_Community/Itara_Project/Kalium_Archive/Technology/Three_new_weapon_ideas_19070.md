# Three new weapon ideas

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-09 19:15:30)

Here are a few new weapons IÂ´ve thought of.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Plasma Cannon (Veichle Weapon)**</span>
> **Damage**: 6d10x2 (Energy) **Points**: 3 **Emplacement Availability**: Military **Cost**: 15000
> A plasma cannon fires bolts of superheated plasma against other ships. These bolts has the powerful ability to sear and melt through armor and superstructure of ships, making them very effective against heavily armored ships. If an attack from a plasma cannon deals damage that equals or exceeds the Damage Threshold of an enemy ship, that ships DR is reduced by 5 until it can be repaired sucessfully. They are short-range weapons however, as the superheated bolts tend to loose efficiency very fast in the vaccum of space.
> <strong>Ranges (Starship Scale/Character Scale)</strong>
> **Point Blank**: 0-1/0-100 **Short**: 2/101-200 **Medium**: -/201-300 **Long**: -/301-500

This I see as being a very uncommon weapon, something perhaps used by smugglers and bounty hunters. But I intend them to be used almost exclusively by a species I am working on, who will use them to create a powerful fleet of short range assault fighters, but lacking capital ships.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Proton Launcher (Character Weapon)**</span>
> **Weapon Group**: Heavy Weapons **Damage**: 6d10 **RoF**: S **Cost**: 5000 **Availability**: Military
> **Stun**: No **Ammo**: 1 **Others**: Accurate
> An expensive weapon, the proton launcher has been developed to be a very effective anti-armor weapon. It is capable of firing over great distances, and it fires heavy proton shells, a variant of the technology used in proton torpedoes, that deals masive damage on impact. Each proton shell costs 500 credits, and can be loaded into the weapon as a move action.

This was meant to be a powerful anti-veichle weapon, looking like a typical Rocket Launcher from any WWII movie or similar. Currently it is more of a very powerful all-round weapon, so if anyone has better ideas to specialize it in, I am all ears, this is just a shell to work with.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Powered Gauntlet (Character Weapon)**</span>
> **Weapon Group**: Exotic **Damage**: 3d4/Unarmed+2 **RoF**: S **Cost**: 3500 **Availability**: Military
> **Stun**: No **Ammo**: 50 **Others**: None
> The powered gauntlet is a very peculiar weapon. While being worn on the hand as a gauntlet, it also contains a wrist-mounted blaster, capable of delivering low-powered blaster shots. This weapon can be used both as a ranged weapon and a melee weapon, dealing damage equal to your unarmed damage +2 whe used in melee. More of a utility tool than an actual weapon, there exists a massive number of enchantments and accessories than can be mounted on the gauntlet. This weapon has 3 unused upgrade slots.
> *Grappling Hook Launcher: Fires a grappling hook attatched to a liquid cable, and can be loaded with two cable dispensers (30m). Costs 1 upgrade slot.
> Stun Cell: The gauntletÂ´s blaster can be set to deal stun damage. Costs 1 upgrade slot.
> Dart Shooter: A small launcher than can release dart weapons. Costs 1 upgrade slot.
> Personal Shield: A personal shield generator of either SR 5 or SR 10. Costs 2 upgrade slots.
> Comlink: A short-range comlink. Costs 1 upgrade slot.
> Rapid Fire: You can use the powered gauntlet in autofire mode.* 
> <strong>Ranges </strong>
> **Point Blank**: 0-10 **Short**: 11-30 **Medium**: 31-50 **Long**: -

This is something I like a lot. This would probably be a most uncommon weapon, possibly unique, and I wrote it up as a signature weapon of an NPC IÂ´ll soon post.

the proton launcher should have a penalty against targets smaller than huge, because otherwise it's broken.

Thanks, thatÂ´s exactly what I was looking for. Maybe a -10 penatly to attack rolls, somewhat similar to the penalty of Capital Ships to fire on ships of Gargantuan size or smaller?

I like the power gauntlet. Mind if I steal it for my Black Fleet pirate write up as it seems like a perfect weapon for ship boarding actions.

Sure thing. I was gonna keep it for a NPC I am making, but I guess he can have a custom-made : . Just remeber, though, I thought these weapons would be extremely unusual, and only certain individuals were supposed to use them.

yeah, I would make the penalty exactly like the light concussion missile launcher in TotG. -10 attack against targets smaller than huge. I would also give the launcher some splash radius

The plasma cannon can be a nasty starship weapon when used repeatedly, but only on smaller ships. A majority of capital ships have a Damage Threshold greater than 120, which is the max damage of the weapon.
A Corellian Corvette, for example, has a Threshold of 138, and it's not a particularly well-armored ship. If the cannon is intended to be used against transport-sized ships, it'll work fine, but if it's intended for smaller capital ships, you'll have to revise the damage upwards.
A x5 multiplier, maybe? No, never mind. It still wouldn't punch through the Corvette's Threshold on average.
Just something to think about, anyway.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-10 13:17:34)

actually, a x2 version and a x5 version would be a good idea.
you've got to remember that, it SHOULDN'T beat the DT every round, otherwise I would say it's a broken weapon.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-10 13:59:25)

Regarding the Proton Launcher, I think IÂ´ll keep it as a single-target weapon. It is supposed to be a highly accurate anti-veichle weapon, and splash effects makes it at least somewhat useful against infantry.
As for the Plasma Cannon, it is supposed to be a short range weapon, mounted on starfighters. The species using it would be more into smaller ship fleets, and would have only maybe 1 or 2 larger ships (Corvette size). Thus these weapons would need to be some kind of threat to larger ships, and I think they are, as long as you use the proper tactics. If grouping six fighters together as a fighter group ala SotG, they would be able to fire at +5 of their normal attack, and deal up to 11d10x2 damage if exceeding the targets RD with 15. ThatÂ´s 110 on average, and I would see it as pretty much of a threat even to somewhat larger ships, especially if each ship perhaps has fire-linked or multiple/enhanced cannons. A x5 version might be a good idea, but IÂ´d rather see this as being a fighter weapon, since itÂ´s supposed to be difficult tecnology to master and create.

Actually . . . yeah, you're right.

I wasn't thinking in terms of fighters, but space transports. In that case, the damage would be fine as it is. It couldn't punch through a Star Destroyer's Threshold, but if it did it might as well be the Death Star.

It wouls serve well as a weapon against fighters ans most smaller capital ships. If used by skilled pilots and fighter groups, it could even be a serious threat to larger capital ships.
But you are right, against an ISD, it has a hard time (as it should be), but still, if the pilots are skilled, the fighters somewhat upgraded, and luck is on their side, they can be force in that game as well.
For instance, in my previous example, you could make the average 130 by having all fighters have 4 fire-linked cannons. Say all pilots are level 10, and you can add +5 to that again. On a critical hit, they would average 270 damage. Also, fighters using these weapons would naturally choose Starship tactics and feats that allows them to take maximum advantage of these weapons.

## Re: Plamsa weapon

### **Rebaav** (2008-10-14 12:02:32)

I'll try to flesh out a concept to see if I understand whats behind this weapon idea.
It's a SWified napalm loogie shooter right? Each gob adheres to the hull thereby weakening it and each new gob that hits adds and reinforces the last hence the DR loss. This could be grounds to say that the 1st hit that breaks DT would reduce the DR by 5 all further weapon strikes from all further weapons permanently to represent this. I'm assuming that it's not culmulative. If it is then it should have a cooling period where the extra DR reduction steps are lost over time if they are not reinforced by further hits that exceed the DR by plasma. The extra DR reductions should only apply to further hits with plasmas where conventional weapons would only have the benifit of the first 5 point reduction and within a set amount of time for it to build.
With this being a "difficult" weapon technology I would think that the refinement and sophistication needed to impliment them as starfighter weapons would not be acheived before it's use as larger weapon on a larger test bed to support it (x5 before x2 refinements). Brute force vs refined precision & ruggedness expected in a comparable fighter weapon. Also an increase in the difficulty to add or repair it would be consistant with this "difficulty". If it is a gob lobber that suggests that, especially on starfighter scale, it is either too difficult (+extra EPs) or not possible to have it fire burst fire.
What are the difficulties & mechanics for repairing lost DR?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-14 13:41:18)

Think of it as a superheated blast of plasma that can only survive for a short time in space (hence the short range of the weapon), that strikes the hull with tremendous force and increadible searing power, digging deep into armor plates, tearing them apart. The DR loss is permanent, meaning that until the ship undergoes some serious repairs, the DR is lowered. I havenÂ´t really figured out the mechanics behind such repairs, but they will take time, and is not something done in-combat (since it requires you to work on the outside of the ship, replacing damaged/lost armor).
The "difficulty" of using this technology is represented by the high cost and EP requirement (higher than most direct fire weapons in SotG). It seems to have gotten lost, but these weapons were meant to be unable to fiire in autofire mode.

### **Frost** (2008-10-14 13:49:01)

hmm having it do permanent DR reduction seems seriously broken to me.
4 hits from this weapon and no ship would have DR against any attacks?
(I think DR 20 is as high as it goes but not sure)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-14 16:31:24)

The DR reduction only takes effect if the damage equals or exceeds the targets damage threshold.
