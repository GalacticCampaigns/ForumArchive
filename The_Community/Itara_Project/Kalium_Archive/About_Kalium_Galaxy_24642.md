Everyone knows Star Wars. The poor farm boy thrust into an impossible adventure and came out a hero. Or about a young slave that was rescued from the sands of Tatooine by a Jedi. What about a galaxy without a Luke, Vader, or Han. A galaxy full of new adventures and unexpected encounters. A place you're not familiar with at all.
With the communities help we will create a unique Star Wars Galaxy. The force is still among its inhabitants and the Jedi are still ever present but in far fewer numbers. New races will make an appearance along with new planets to explore.
During various stages of the galaxy's creation members will be allowed to submit their ideas and creations. Those ideas/creations chosen will be added to the credits and there name, item, or weapon will be added to the Galaxy.
Our system breaks the galaxy up into small manageable parts. Starting with planets, then Species, ect. Instead of trying to come up with the entire galaxy in one fell swoop were just going with the core worlds. Basically gathering enough information to get the galaxy on its feet, make it feel alive and let the players and GMâ€™s help flesh out the world with their campaigns. We are taking the route that nets us excellent content with a playable galaxy in the quickest amount of time.
The steps and what we will work on next are listed below:

1. Planets - Establishing the planets of the Galactic Core
2. Species of the galaxy - Establishing the main species of the galaxy.
3. Creatures - Establishing the beasts that roam the planets.
4. Factions - Establishing a few factions within the galaxy.
5. Vehicles - Establishing the land based, airborne and space faring vehicles in the galaxy.
6. Prominent NPCs - Famous, wealthy, villainous, crime lord, these are the main NPCs that will populate the core worlds.
7. Weapons and Armor - Establishing the guns, explosives, and armor that one can find in this new galaxy.

By this time Weapons and Armor are complete the galaxy should be playable for GMs and players.
Content once the galaxy is up and running will be by submissions and a review board. The review boards job is to make sure the content fits, that there are no obvious clashes with existing content .
Anything approved by the review board is considered canon for the Kalium Galaxy. GMs and players alike are allowed to submit histories for the Kalium galaxy based off of their adventures, however nothing canon is to be changed (death of an major NPC for instance) without approval from the board.
