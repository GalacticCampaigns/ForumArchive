# Kalium Hyperspace Poll

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-20 23:26:29)

Here's the poll you were asking for, Thraken.
If anyone has any suggestions for improving Kalium's hyperspace system, post in the Travel and Hyperspace thread already. Your suggestions don't help if nobody hears them. A summary follows, which I outright stole from Rebaav and Thraken (who had expanded on Breeder's ideas). So thanks to them.

> Jump schedules are available by open computer access in the vicinity of the Gate (use communications rules if desired) and travelling ships must purchase a jump position for the given journey. Depending on the Gate this may be completely automated, handled by living staff or both. 30 minutes before a given jump alerts begin broadcast and the ships are required to take up their positions (DC 10 Pilot) or miss the jump and forfeit their fee.

> A warp drive uses exotic technology in order to punch a hole in space. As the device is fixed to the ship, the entire hull and some surrounding spacetime is sucked through the hole and thus is &#39;warped&#39; to a space-time position. Uncontrolled it is supremely dangerous&ndash;ranging from being totally lost in the universe to ripping the universe a new space time singularity. With a lot of careful calibration however, it is the ultimate interstellar drive.
> The drives use the same table values as hyperdrives with the exception of availability and base cost. The multiplier is used to determine the number of minutes required to charge a Warp Drive for a jump in normal circumstances.
> Making a jump is a DC 30 Use Computer astrogation check. Nominal jumps are between destinations within the same region. To jump to a distant destination one must have detailed navigation data for the origin and the destination (one day old or less), or attempt to calculate the way to the region. For each region to be traversed, increase the DC by 5.
> With an hour of uninterrupted stellar cartography and a DC 30 Use Computer sensor check, you may reduce the astrogation DC by 5. This may be repeated, however there is only so much navigational data one can obtain from their position. For each subsequent stellar cartography check add 5 to the DC.
> If a jump is made using a failed astrogation check, take damage from a failed jump as normal and roll a Major Space Travel Hazard (p99 Scum and Villainy). For every 3 points the check was failed, roll another Major Space Travel Hazard.

> Special: One may manually exit the hyperjump early with a DC 25 Pilot check to disrupt the hyperspace tunnel yet avoid damage. A failed check rolls for damage in the same way as an astrogation check.
> This may be done tactically so that one may &#39;check&#39; the destination they&#39;re heading into or even theoretically go to a place between your origin and destination.

> Public access systems are seperate from the Gate&#39;s core functions. This may be accessed remotely by DC10 communications and is considered Indifferent with Intelligence 20 and a Will defense of 20. Depending on the quality of the Hyper Gate the Intelligence and thus Will Defense score of the station may vary.
> To access the core functions the gateway of the public systems must be hacked to friendly status before you can take advantage of its hardwired network with the Navigational Computers. It possesses the same Intelligence and Will Defense as other computer systems but starts as Hostile.
> Alternatively direct access in person would skip the public network.

> **Illegal jump wrote:**
>
> There are two methods to taking advantage of a hacked Gate. The easier and more insidious method is to change a scheduled jump&#39;s destination. This requires the hyperspace course to be plotted, and by a virus, remote or direct command, switch the data just after the scheduled jump is plotted and before initiation.
> The main hurdle is plotting the course given that only stellar cartographers, Gate operators, Hyperspace Ferries and mad people who use Warp Drives generally possess navicomputers. If one does not possess a navicomputer then the course must be plotted on the gate&#39;s own navicomputer, during which your operations may be detected. The age of the data available for a given destination is similar to the frequency in which they are travelled from the gate.
> This is regarded on the level of a major terrorist attack due to the widespread psychological effect of a &#39;misjump&#39; or diverted jump. Much of the galaxy already loathe their great dependance on the Hyper Gates for galactic travel and commerce as they must place their faith in operators and systems beyond their control. The lucky ones may be diverted to a different major destination with its own local Hyper Gate and a swarm of Gate Security to stop and investigate all ships involved in the jump. The unlucky ones may be diverted to places unknown and never heard from again.
> The more problematic but bystander friendly approach is to initiate the jump yourself. The problem stems from the fact that on an unauthorised approach to the jump position they will immediately jump to high alert, attempt to stop your ship and run diagnostics against unauthorised access. Even if the run is successful, they will have a record of your ship.

Actually what I'd proposed was making it sitewide to get everyone to look at the damn thing :P

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-23 18:00:26)

I talked it over with simply, and I put up a link to it from the main General Discussion forum, but that's the best I can do at the moment. Sorry.
I also saw that somebody voted no. Okay, but what don't you like? No's don't do us any good without reasons.

### **Rebaav** (2009-06-25 08:43:52)

@ Thraken
I understand the need to poll and unfortunately it seems the majority of this forums populace doesn't seem to contribute to the Kallium project so perhaps that is the only way to get feedback.
The quote from my text was an observation so I'm unclear as to it's inclusion in a poll. Perhaps I need to clarify what I said so as to help my confusion. IIRC HRings are not in the cannonical SW universe but I'm to understand that they are in Kallium. If that is true then that technology introduces everything related to it that would logically need to be there to support it including the resulting culture.
Perhaps that helps clarify it. It's an observation. You can't have a technology in a culture without systemic & cultural support for it. The HRing, as presented, is "established" therefore what maintains that, I feel, should be spelled out. Hope that helps.

I saw it as I was compiling all the posts for this thread and thought it provided a good introduction. To tell you the truth, I didn't even realize what I had taken was out of context that way. I see (now that I'm looking) that it really has no place where I put it, but I still think it makes a decent introduction to anyone unfamiliar with what we're doing, if you don't mind me using it that way.

Oh certainly that's fine and I agree. My only concern is that it seemed odd as a poll choice ;D.

### **Thraken** (2009-06-30 10:20:34)

Well, given the response so far it's more or less go with it.
However I wanna know what the dissenter thinks about it all -_-

### **Rebaav** (2009-06-30 11:17:46)

I think we need more votes...

Would Rowen be able to send out a message to the board members requesting responses?

### **Thraken** (2009-06-30 13:10:01)

Now is that more or less intrusive than my request to have the poll show up forumwide? :P

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-15 19:54:45)

I'm pretty sure there are more votes there now than before this recent surge so please will the 'no' please describe what is wrong with the system and 'yes but's please say what needs work.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-10-15 20:05:05)

I was the No Vote.
In my opinion, the entire system is just to complicated.
Do We need Stargates, AND hyperdrives AND "Warp" Drives?

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-15 20:14:23)

Blame the other guys :P they wanted and ancient but not very good hyperdrive technology and a system of stargates that almost every damn space based computer game uses.
I was happy with just one internal drive but the others went with the above so I just developed it along to the point in the poll to try and keep things moving.
It does make sense for different groups to have different FTL tech, but the backstory the guys came up with made it a rather even and homogenous spread of these three drives throughout the galaxy <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ -->

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-10-16 03:46:23)

I like the Hyper gates. They create control, and limits. This allows taxes, and tariffs, and makes it easy to explain trade routes, and prevents every Tom, Dick, and Harry just jumping randomly around.
We had to have hyper ships, because...well, it's Star Wars. Heroes can't be stuck in *traffic*, after all.
Warp...thingies. There was a discussion about alternate modes of FTL, but I figured they would just have different names, and the same rules. Perhaps we should just say certain speeds of hyperdrives are *this* tech, and other speeds are *that* tech and *that* tech. Simple, the fewest rules changes, and all that.
I still think FTL built into ships should be expensive as all get out. Make the players pay for absolute freedom.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-16 06:12:26)

I´m throwing my vote for "no" here as well. I´m just not a big fan of the whole idea, but I did like the suggestion we had before to simply use hyperdrives as normal, but make them scarcer, bulkier, and more expensive.

I'll agree with that. Having them as common as they are in GFFA never made sense to me.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-16 08:42:23)

*pours fuel over everything and sets fire to it*
Back to square one then?
Please tell me what you all decide, cos I can't determine the size of my group till I know how interstellar travel even works.

---

### **master_Tru** (2009-10-16 08:43:48)

I personaly like the idea, but in a different way then it was pitched. To maintain the star wars feel we could still use the familar hyper drives etc .... but littered throughout the galaxy are these ancient hyper rings the first hyper drive tech prototypes. Some might even still be functional. To me this way it could only add to a story line, and any GM`s wanting to run ancient setting games could have the hyper rings as the sole and popular method of space travel.

I like this too. In some regions the frequency of the rings/slingshots could be much higher than other regions where there are none. Perhaps a difference of "Core" vs "Rim"?

### **Thraken** (2009-10-16 10:01:00)

The model of hyperdrive as is currently burning was basically that they were so huge and expensive that huge hyperbarges which carried or pulled ships through hyperspace were mandatory if you wanted to use hyperdrive.
By less common do you mean that it's comparable to modern aviation and sea travel in that only the richest can buy private yachts or jets capable of inter continental travel and richer still to have one with adventurely useful features?
And for everyone else even if you are well sponsored the most you'd be able to get is a long range sailboat if you convince them it's for a cause like racing round the world <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Sounds like the FTL service offered by the whoevers in Dune. I think they were called HighLiners? An entire culture completely devoted to providing FTL to everyone else because to do it right they had to be all in or not at all. That did lead to coruption and a political mess that Dune deals with (Spide trade & influence). Wars were fought with their support, to move the machines of war into place, or not at all.
I'd think though that we'd want to stay away from that kind of mess in Kallium. It makes for a great epic interstellar/intergallactic politcal riot but a rather oppressive and closed FTL dynamic. Not nearly as open as GFFA and very much puppet string with GMs on the other end since I'm sure PCs would not want to just be cruise ship crew.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-16 10:42:48)

So, perhaps we should go for keeping the regular hyperspace/hyperdrive system, but increase the cost (in space and credits) of hyperdrives? And maybe tweak some of the astrogation rules a bit?
I´m asking, because I´m planning on posting a collection thread on "house rules" to the starship creation rules later tonight, which should include stuff like "all hyperdrives costs 3 EP more, and has costs x10".

I'd say that this is at least what should happen, yes. Including the HRings in a Core(+HRings) vs Rim(-HRings) arrangement would add an actual unique flavour (IE: "Kallium") that I feel we should consider.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-16 11:13:30)

Re. astrogation rules I feel we should retrograde it to RCR form as it's a pretty good system for distance and travel time. We could keep saga rules for problems caused by bad astrogation checks though.
We already have Vader's base map to work from.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-16 11:16:10)

Rebaav, absolutely, but I´d consider such things as going under "New Technology", and thus be a separate thing. For the purpose of determining general FTL travel across the Kalium Galaxy, it seems like the debate has gone in favor of using regular hyperdrives, but have them be rarer and more costly than in the Lucas-verse.
I think I´ll be posting the Rules thread tonight, complete with a few suggestions from me, based on how the discussions have been going. The thread will be open for debate of course, but it seems important to gather a common ground to stand on.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-10-16 11:20:25)

Okay. I have a suggestion.
We use the standard hyperdrive/hyperspace rules as normal.
However, in place of hypergates, we have wormhole junctions. Natural phenomenon that allow instant travel between two systems. (This is an idea that comes directly from the Honor-verse novels by David Weber)
This would provide the taxation/ established trade routes that Breader liked about the hypergates, but as a natural phenomenon they are limited in destination requiring the use of a traditional drive to get to many places.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-16 12:28:41)

If we must have a fixed Spacegate/Hyperspace Cannon/Wormhole thing the scientist in me requests that it should be the "ancient super civ did it" angle and that it should be a technologically started instantanous or very short term phenomenon over a stable wormhole that just sits there forever.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-16 13:22:51)

Personally, I was a fan of the gates, for much the same reason as Breeder was. (On that note, why the heck am I agreeing with him so much today?) I'm not so sure about the wormhole thing, but what if the gates were built in areas where space/time was weaker, allowing the gates to punch through it to create travel to any other location with weak space/time (and other gates)?
I like the idea of expensive hyperdrives, but we do want our players to be able to travel the galaxy. Drives that are slower than the gates could work, or maybe they can only be used for short trips?
Basically, the gates would become toll highways, with the hyperdrives acting as ordinary roads after that. The gates get you across the galaxy, but the hyperdrives get you from one system to another.

Mass Effect travel system?

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-16 16:09:36)

Is it? I've never played it.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-16 16:15:43)

Regions of space are connected by massive 'Mass Relays' that fire ships or arguably any object off at super FTL speeds to another galactic region and Mass Relay. From there the ship uses the much less powerful onboard Mass Effect drives to move to the local systems.
A side effect of that system in that setting is that the setting is not necessarily 'The Galaxy' but just the areas around the Mass Relays.

I'm not keen on the entire setting and galactic civilisation essentially being tethered to the [Whatever the hell we using for long range travel] things. What about the great frontier that's not in reach of one of these?

Hyperdrives can still be used--but if we're making them more expensive and/or slower, they need someway to the around the galaxy. It just makes scouting sound more dangerous, what with using less reliable transportation to do the work. Star Wars was never about exploration, anyway (though scouts still play a role).
