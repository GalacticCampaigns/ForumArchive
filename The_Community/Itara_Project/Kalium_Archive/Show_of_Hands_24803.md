Alicia has asked me to consider revitalising the Kalium Galaxy once more. This is a task I'm prepared to take on, but I need to know who among our existing contributors still considers themselves part of the project so we can work out how to proceed. Post here please. New community members should feel free to express their interest in contributing too.

I´m still up for the task, though I think we need some better structure if anything is ever to come of it. Having people responsible for each section is a good start.
One thing I´ve noticed is that every time we try to get this going again, we get stuck over the basic history of the Galaxy. Okay, we get stuck on several things, but this seems to be the biggest issue. Thus I would like to suggest a different approach, just as an option:
We start with focusing on species and planets, thus making sure the Galaxy has a population. Certain key technological developments should also be decided on, like the fact that hyperdrives are scarcer and more expensive than normal.
Then, when we have a sufficient number of pieces we can begin to put together a galactic history. Why don´t these two species gets along? Why is this planet one big battlefield? How did the invention of hyperdrives affect the Galaxy? How come this particular species have developed into fierce warriors, perhaps they were ancient conquerors? Taken together, the answers to such questions can form major points in a timeline, with more minor events added later.

Yes, this is something Alicia and I are agreed on. I've made an initial draft for a set of submission rules/guidelines which I'm going to check with Alicia before we make them formal. I've also been developing a set of templates (so far incomplete) - what I've got so far in this regard has been posted as a blog entry.
> Having people responsible for each section is a good start.

My intended model would have a panel of three people reviewing each section. That way we still get a lively and thought out selection process, while simultaneously being more productive than when everyone and their mother have a say (such as was occurring with the timeline discussion).

I quite agree. I always thought it would be best to build the history more organically as we developed the things that would be significant to the development of said history. We were trying to build a jigsaw without any of the pieces being in the box.

I would actually say that we should keep it as we did before, with a single person responsible for a section. The reason is that any discussions will naturally take place in the thread where something is posted, where everyone can be involved, and the only thing you really need is someone who can put an end to the discussion when it is resolved or stuck, and that can be accomplished better by one than three persons I think.

If you recall we attempted this, and even that wasn't working. I have been reviewing Simply's proposed process and it is so far looking promising. Something new needs to be attempted or we will continue proceeding in circles.

I am proposing a more formal submission process because under the current model submissions were being made and they were all making it through the process but nothing was actually being selected as "official Kalium material".
Ideas can be knocked about on the forum to get a general idea of people's opinions and to get help with balancing issues without the need for any kind of moderator. But when it comes time to actually make a submission I believe it would be better to have more than just one person responsible for accepting it - if you only have one person, that entire section of the Kalium experience becomes biased by their own personal agenda.
I don't mean "agenda" in a sinister way, but we all have our own interests and preferences, which will colour selection decisions if left in the hands of one person.

Once Alicia has approved this model I'll post the full guidelines along with a summary. I'm quite confident that the reasoning behind my decisions will be apparent. Whether it will work or not, we'll have to see, but Alicia is quite right in that it's better to try something new than continue with something we know to have failed. Hopefully the community will be supportive of this otherwise another attempt will be doomed early on.

I´m all for replacing bad ideas with better ones, though I thought it worked pretty well last time, at least in the sectors I was active in. You know, apart from interest seemingly dying out, which I think was mainly due to us getting stuck on the whole timeline issue again.
My main concern was just that we now get a two-leveled discussion, with first the community at large, and then the three "chosen", which gives so many more opportunities to get stuck in a debate and never reach any conclusions. I´m not saying it has to be that way, just that the risk increases.
That said, I´m sure that whatever you put together will work out as long as we get a little more structure in it. A suggestion would be to make it a complete restart though, and wipe the slate entirely clean, emptying the sections. It is my experience that when redoing something it is better to tear down the old and rebuild it from scratch.

I´m not saying it has to be that way, just that the risk increases.

I'll summarise what actually happens in the process I have outlined.

* A designer submits their idea. They may have talked it over on the boards with other people, or they may not have. Doing so is not important to the submission process but may be important to the designer's own creative process, and may give them an indicator of whether the idea is likely to be accepted.
* A panel of 3 have a short discussion of the merits and flaws of the submission and make their judgement. Majority vote wins, which is why nothing will get stuck at this stage.
* The submission becomes Potential Content, which means it is a strong candidate for final inclusion but needs to go through further scrutiny and testing by the community. Consider this the playtest/Beta Test stage.
* The community are allowed a short window of opportunity to have their say and do any reviewing/testing they think is necessary. They may or may not actually do so. Again majority consensus from responses is used, so a decision WILL be reached one way or the other (if no one posts anything then the decision of the original panel will be honoured). If the feedback is positive the submission becomes Canonical Content. Note that this stage may largely be a formality if the submission met with approval before entering the submission process.

I've been considering this, and I think that, at the very least, ideas we want to keep should be resubmitted through the new process (not necessarily by the original author, just by anyone who wants to keep them). I don't want to lose everything, but we'll know what ideas have support from the community by what people choose to resubmit. Those that aren't resubmitted are dead weight in any case.

Okay, sounds like a solid process to me. Hopefully it works out in practice as well.

Won't know till be try it. If it doesn't we just go back to the drawing board.
