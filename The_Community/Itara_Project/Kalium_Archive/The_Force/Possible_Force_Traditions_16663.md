# Possible Force Traditions

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-12 20:18:55)

Currently, all names were drawn from the [list](http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&Itemid=48&func=view&catid=24&id=13878 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&Itemid=48&func=view&catid=24&id=13878") of Force Users I got from Wookieepedia.
**The Make Up**
Going with my thoughts about Force Organizations, I sought to make each one unique, focused, and in opposition to each other. Each order uses the Force with two 'descriptors': Knowledge, Battle, and Sorcery. The Jedi, being Warrior Monks, have Battle and Knowledge descriptors. The Bendu Monks, however, have a double dose of Knowledge. This was intended to help craft new powers/abilities, and to sculpt which group got ready access to which powers.
Bendu Knowledge, Knowledge
Jedi Knowledge, Battle
Sith Battle, Sorcery
Ysanna Battle, Battle
Jensaarai Knowledge, Sorcery
Witches of Dathomi Sorcery, Sorcery
**Basics**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Bendu**
*The Force shall show you the path*
Outlook: The Bendu have long mastered the art of Farseeing, and use it to see the path of the galaxy. However, with this knowledge comes the understanding that interference will cause more pain and suffering. Thus, when they do act, it is usually in an effort to keep to path the Unseen Force has foretold them.
Opponents: Jensaarai
Signature Power: Farseeing
Weapon of Choice: Unarmed Strike
**Jedi**
*Peace within, Peace without.*
Outlook: To use the Force with emotion is an anthem to the Jedi. In their view, the Force is a powerful gift that shouldn't be used carelessly. To this effect, the Jedi are bastions of relaxation and calmness, even amidst battle. While few Jedi Masters can claim never to have chosen paths without strong emotions, the actions they took while on that path were coolly executed.
Opponents: Sith
Signature Power: Battle Mediation
Weapon of Choice: Lightsaber
**Sith**
*To know the Living Force, one must* live*.*
Outlook: The Sith are perhaps the most sensational of the Force Orders. Empathic in their belief that all of life are parts of the Living Force, one must know each part of life to full understand it. Love, hate, joy and sadness are not only expected parts of Sith training, but also a requirement. It goes without saying the Sith can be the most volatile of all the traditions, but also the most loving.
Opponents: Jedi
Signature Power: Empathy
Weapon of Choice: Sith Sword (the CIV?)
**Ysanna**
*Chaos is death.*
Outlook: Founded by a Jedi soldier who had seen too much death and destruction during the chaos of the second galactic war, the Ysanna Regiment is one of structure. They act as peace keepers, mercenaries, and bounty hunters, seeking to bring stablization to the galaxy. A small organization; the Ysanna are very particular to who they let join;, they know they cannot accomplish their mission in a short time, so they focus on doing what they can.
Opponents: Witches of Dathomi
Signature Power: Bending the Bullet
Weapon of Choice: Slug thrower pistols and rifles
**Jensaarai**
*Wait not for Evil to cross your doorway; cross Evil's door first.*
Outlook: The Jensarri are perhaps the most proactive and all the Force Traditions, actively seeking out wrongs to write. Called Paladins in some systems, they are welcomed with cautious arms. While they do, in fact, hunt down criminals and wrong doers, they do so without care of local law, nor do they consider the consequences. Getting between a Jensarri and her target is said to be a very dangerous, almost as dangerous as standing between that same Jensarri and her family.
Opponents: Bendu
Signature Power: Hunter's Path
Weapon of Choice: Jensarri Lance; like a CIV, only a long bladed spear
**Witches of Dathomi**
*Live with the Force.*
Outlook: The Witches of Dathomi draw most of their teachings from nature, discarding technology as an affront to the Force. They are free spirits, wandering where they will, doing their best to experience life on every planet while leaving as small of a mark as possible. "Choice" is the prayer of this tradition, and anything that limits it is the Witches' bane. They have made great enemies of every slavery in the galaxy, for example.
Opponents: Ysanna
Signature Power: Nature's Wrath
Weapon of Choice: Force Powers; notably Nature's Wrath

**History**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Force is said to bind the universe together. In the Kalium galaxy, it also almost tore the galaxy apart, twice. To understand how a energy created by the very essence of living creature could result in so much death, one much understand the history of the Force, and those who interact with it on a daily basis.
While there are hundreds of thousands of Force Users today, this was hardly the case throughout history. The first recognized Force Users were called the Bendu Monks, after the planet they formed their order on. They were reclusive sages, living peaceful lives on planets light-years away from each other, completely unaware of each otherâ€™s existence. Given their choice, they would have remained that way. Sadly, that choice was not theirs to make.
At the beginning of the Hyper-space Wars, a group of immoral scientists were tasked with the creation of new weapon systems to defeat a technological enemy. To accomplish this, the scientists sought new energy sources. Everything was considered, ranging from the simple and mundane to the most fantastic and mystical. This line of thinking brought them to a lowly monk in the mountains of their home world. This monk was said to be capable of strange and wondrous acts, beyond that of mortals. Thus, the scientists sought him out.
Despite depraved and heinous experiments, they could not draw any of this energy out of the monk before he died. The scientists were forced to look for others. Using the Hyper-space wars as cover, immortal organizations gathered just over twenty of these gifted individuals, and brought them all to Bendu. No one knows how long the monks were captives, what species they were gathered from, or what organization spawned the twisted researchers. It is known that only ten monks survived the ordeal.
The monks were, as a rule, pacifists. Those that were knowledgeable in the way of battle only used their skills as a form of mediation. Almost universally, they were all revered on their home world, untouchable by the locals, and never had a cause to deal harm to another living creature- or even to imagine dealing harm. But after the torturous treatment and the deaths of their fellows, they turned their Force imbued eyes not to their inner selves, and to their captors. Together, they Monks broke free of their captors, using their abilities in terrible and frightful ways. Of their captors, those that did not flee were never seen again.
Two of the Monks were especially remembered for their actions during their fight for freedom. While the stories are far from complete, it is known that the actions of these two Monks made it possible for the others to act at all. Many generations later, the philosophies of these two monks would used as the foundations of the Sith and Jedi traditions.
The scientists attempted to erase their mistake by destroying the planet, and succeeding in scorching Bendu of all lifeâ€¦save the surviving Monks. The remaining half-score of Monks decided to stay on Bendu, and recreate the planet, and to share their knowledge of the Unseen Force with each other. They faced many difficulties, and overcame them one by one. Without ships and supplies, they called out across the galaxy, contacting others through the Force. Those that answered the call brought materials, food, and more people. Then colonists followed, and more supplies, expert technicians, builders, farmer, and more, until the wasted planet had a sustainable, stable settlement.
And then, Bendu disappeared.
The planet never moved, nor did any records of it ever cease to exist. But galaxy wide, every living creature forgot about it. If ever someone saw it listed on a star map, theyâ€™re eyes would glance over the image without noting it. Stories that referred to it were told using different names. Those with relatives that went to the planet could never quite remember which planet their family went to. Anyone who left Bendu remembered they worked on a different planet, in another system. Thus, Bendu remained a truly lost planet for generations.
What caused the ***Bendu Monks*** to drop their Force born invisibility is unknown, save something that the Monks referred to as the Black Age. Where the Order was usually prone to hiding truth behind philosophy and half-spoken rituals, mentioning the Black Age always brought silence. The mundane creatures that dwell on the planet, only loosely affiliated with the order, also maintain their silence, though most can claim with absolute certainty they know nothing of it.
After Bendu reappeared, more travelers came to the tiny planet, though few ever stayed. Among the number that stayed were those interested in learning more about the Benduâ€™s way, and that of the Unseen Force. Generations went by, and the order grew. Other monasteries were constructed on other planets, so the Bendu Way could guide others to the Unseen Force. The order flourished, grew, and learned.
The Bendu Way is one of peaceful contemplation. They were- and are- wise men. They study the Force, and each other. They seek no power over any others, nor do they seek to change the galaxy. Theirs was- and is- a way of open acceptance. If you can to study the Unseen Force, you were allowed, despite your species, gender, and planet of birth. Those that did not come to join the order came to ask these wise men for advice and counsel, and the order survived off the donations these seekers gave. While wars waged in the void above their planets, the Bendu studied the Force, and sought to find their inner peace.
After many generations, the Bendu planet held too many Force Users and their families. Some of the Monks, citing the sheer multitudes of potential Force Users and how out-of-the-way Bendu was, petitioned to have other monasteries built on other planets. Permission was granted, but with a caution. Do not involve yourselves in the politics and schemes of the galaxy, the eldest Monk's warned. Time of Great Death await everyone should you do this. A promise to keep to the Bendu way was made, and the missionaries departed.
This way almost came to an end when one of the monasteries was destroyed. The order became split between those who wished to take arms against the unknown attackers- some for vengeance, some to prevent it from happening again- and those who wished only to be left in peace. This rift widened when the militant group left their monasteries and hunted for the attackers. The militant Bendu- still very much untrained in battle- sought out other groups, and traded their mastery over the Unseen Force for the manpower and skills to hunt the attackers.
The truth behind the destruction of the monastery is a secret still kept by a few, but that secret finally tore the order apart. The militant half of the Bendu Order split from the pacifist side, and then split again. Those that stayed in the order retreated back into their monasteries, renewing their promise to avoid the galaxy as a whole. The militant sideâ€¦they were just getting started.
The militant half of the Bendu order split again, and squared off against each other. Each side went to gather allies, making promises, treaties, and swearing to grant this House or that House â€œthe aid of the Bendu foresightâ€ after that houseâ€™s hated enemy was crushed. The various Houses, having seen the effectiveness of the Benduâ€™s farseeing powers during their hunt just a few years before, jumped on the chance to have that power supporting them. In the end, it seemed like the whole galaxy went to war.
Thus the beginning, and end of the First Force War.
What was once one tradition has split into three. The Bendu Monks let it be known that any returning to their monasteries would be forgiven of all crimes. Those that thought the monks too passive and too introspective, gathered together in a more martial order, and named themselves ***Jedi***, after the teachings of one of the two heroes of the horrors of the Bendu (the first formation of the Bendu Order). They saw what too little control would do, and sought to stamp out any emotion that would lead to another war. The Jedi are Warrior Sages, skill in single martial combat, and disciplined through years of study.
The Third Tradition, named ***Sith*** after the second hero of the Bendu Order, split away to seek freedom. The Force, they claimed, came from life, and in Order to use the Force, one must live. They sought to gain power from their emotions, and to guide this power to better the galaxy. The Sith are studious like their Bendu ancestors, but focus more on using their powers then just contemplating them.
Both the Jedi and the Sith sought to make good their promises, joining with the various houses, and spreading their teachings far and wide. Even before smoke had settled from the First Force War, skirmishes between the two orders began.
Generations later, when every House had its own Force User, be they Sith or Jedi, tensions began to mount once more. Border clashes between Houses, philosophical arguments between Orders, power struggles and resource struggles all came to head, sparking the Second Force War. Great fleets, from every corner of the galaxy, swarmed each other, each with a Jedi or Sith on the bridge. At first, it was House on House, and Order on Order, but before long, inner House power struggles, and conflicts of loyalty in the Force Users fractured alliances, fermented betrayals, and tossed the galaxy into chaos. The battles ravaged whole systems, leaving smoldering planets in its wake. No one was left untouched by this war; those not killed or had their mind torn asunder lost family, homes, and livelihoods. This, it seemed, was the death throes of the galaxy.
The Second Force War did not end abruptly, nor was there ever an official cease fire called for many years. Instead, the battles petered out as those still living grew tired of the bloodshed and battle. The official end came two years after the last large battle was fought, more as an agreed upon moment than anything else. Also during this afterthought, the Galactic Council was formed, and its first ruling was the end of the War, with no victory announced, and no fault levied. Its second ruling was baring any Bendu, Jedi, or Sith from ever holding political office, or a military rank. The Councilâ€™s second ruling is known to be the first ignored.
The horrors perpetrated on both sides of the conflict were horrible. All manner of crimes were committed, and many grew disgusted with their respective Orders. The Jedi and the Sith called for their members to return, while the Bendu Monks restated their calm acceptance of any willing to lay their weapons down. Most accepted one of these three offers. The majority of those who did not, slipped away to live normal lives, far away from what brought so much death to the galaxy. There were those, however, who could not bring themselves to step away from the Force, yet could not return to those who they saw as so very wrong. These few began teaching new ways of the Force. After many generations, few of these traditions resemble the Bendu philosophies, or even that of the Jedi or Sith Traditions.
The first to form was the ***Witches of Dathomi***, willing outcasts of the Sith Traditions. In keeping with their progenitors, they valued freedom over control, and sought to live with nature as opposed to fighting against it. While this resulted in tradition lacking as many warriors as the other orders, they made up for it in their wide array of abilities; it is said that some of the â€œspellsâ€ the witches use are unknown even to the Bendu monks. Dathomi was the name of one of the Bendu founders, whose descendants formed the Sith Tradition.
The next group, another off shoot of the Sith, are the ***Jensaarai***; the order drew it's name from a story about one of the founding members of the Bendu tradition. The word, reputed to be the only one the monk every said, meant family. They directly opposed the Bendu Monks, seeking action over stasis, aggression over passiveness. For them, one does not wait at home for evil to come, but it must be sought out and destroyed. The Jensaarai are known for their magi, war wizards forcing on enhancing their troupes, and using their powers in an offensive manner.
The youngest Order is the also the most organized. Founded by a Jedi who refused to return to the Order, the ***Ysanna*** the old speech world for Protection is a tradition of warriors. Taking from various military backgrounds, the Ysanna are soldiers first and foremost. Where the Jedi seek to stamp out wayward emotion, the Ysanna seek to stamp out Chaos. To that end, they are mercenaries, strict on who the hire out to, and always in small units. They are perhaps the weakest in their powers, but are well known for their abilities to augment slug thrower fire arms with their minor skills.
These six no longer war openly with each other, but conflicts arise. Jedi still oppose the Sith, the Ysanna and the Witches cannot abide each other, and the Jensaarai are polar opposites to the ancient Bendu, but none longer seek open war.
What happens in the shadows, howeverâ€¦

</details>

While I would love to see these accepted as a whole, I won't jump up and down and stomp my feet (where yawl can see me) if they ain't. I will stress I think all Force Traditions need an opposing school of thought.
Also, I tired to make each tradition viable as for a player to use. Yes, each are flawed. This is so they can be used as bad guys. I think this fits better with the many traditions and nations.
Last thing...the history is far from prefect, complete, or even official. Rowan said he had full rights to that (I think?) so I jut made some stuff up.
Hope yawl enjoy.

I am still a little uncomfortable with the while "all traditions needs an opposing school of thoughts" idea. It would seem much more natural to just develop each traditions philiosophy and ways, and to just naturally see which clashes.
For example, the Sith and the Jedi naturally clash, since one is based on embracing and using your powerful emotions, while the other strives to keep them under control and use the Force without passion. The Dathomiri Witches would naturally be more in line with the Sith, since their free spirits and natural philosophies would typically involve a lot of emotions. The Bendu Monks on the other hand, has a philosophy of watching and waiting, not to take drastic actions, and only to interfer when necessary, much more in line with the Jedi philosophy.
Also, in an attempt to further enhance the classification system you made, I would suppose a few new "descriptors" for the traditions: Split "Battle" into Offense/Defense, Domination, Guidance, Corruption.

You can break down the Force Traditions in Luscas-verse into to categories: *"Jedi & Sith"*, and *"everyone else"*. The big difference between the two groups is that the Jedi and Sith have each other. An opposing school of thought helps them define themselves, creates a history, and builds social interaction. The Big Two in Luscas-verse are major factors in the galactic affairs, playing huge roles in history in general, and are talked about all the time.
"Everyone else" are only foot notes. This is why I think opposing schools are necessary.
Here is another thought, and it goes against my Bendu Monk idea. The Jedi and Sith traditions differ from the others in Luscas-verse in another way. They are proactive. Few, if any, of the smaller traditions ever leave their planet of origin, while the Big Two are always out to conquer this, defend that, explore here, go there, work up a treaty over that way, spy over this way, etc. Perhaps, to be a big Force Tradition, they need to be proactive, always doing something. Of course, having a built in enemy helps find you something to do.
Perhaps the Bendu are actively sculpting destiny, but in a way they see fit? That might more sense.

Kicking this around.  It was only a place for me to start.  It's late for me, but I'll think on it.

just wondering, how large are the sith in this galaxy? because I would love to make some sith npc's.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 14:19:15)

hey, so I'm going to attempt a new write-up of the Kel Dor, and I was interested in making them a part of the Bendu tradition, anyone have any comments or suggestions on that?

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-11-23 00:41:02)

I hesitate to assign a race to any tradition. I'd rather see a footnote saying these species are naturally inclined to that tradition than and out and out permanent assignment.
But, its just a nit pick.
