In case you haven't been following other threads. I've taken over the responcibility of overseeing the more mystical side of Kallium. This includes Force Traditions and Force Powers.
**Summary**:
A one paragraph summary of the tradition.
**History**:
a brief (at least 2 paragraphs but no more then 5 ) history of the tradition.
**Location**:
List the "Strongholds" of the tradition. The regions were they have the most followers.
**Philosophy**:
what is the unique outlook on the Force that leads this tradition from the mainstream teachings of the Jedi? (Please include at least 2 paragraphs but no more then 5) This is also where you include membership requirements.
And finally, the **Tradition talent tree**.
The tradition has 5 talents (no more, no less) associated with it, to represent its unique teachings. Please include a short description of what the talent does (and a brief example if appropriate)
For Force Powers:
Again, Use the format in the JATM.
