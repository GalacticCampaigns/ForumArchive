# The Ysanna

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-09 14:30:10)

So, if our Hutts are the self-appointed police force of the galaxy, that would make them a very powerful faction in the galaxy, especially since they're Force-Sensitive. Let's start with the basics.
1. What do we call them? I'm drawing a complete blank on this.
2. How is the organization set up? I was thinking (yes, I know that can be dangerous) that the organization would be divided into sectors (like the Moffs) where a single Hutt patrols each sector. Ths Hutt simply wanders around, bringing his form of justice to the sector and sticking his proverbial nose into everything, especially where it's not wanted.
3. How much authority do they have? The Hutts *believe* they are the absolute moral authority in the galaxy, and will bring their form of justice to it. Some Hutts would be content to supervise, while others will take a very active role in policing their sector.
4. I think it was Breeder of Puppets who pointed out that every Force-using organization needs another one to oppose them. So, who opposes them?
Anyway, that's what I've got so far.

1. How about...[Ysanna](http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=584 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=584") from my Possible Force Traditions thread? Hutts, especially Force Sensitive Hutts, was not the way I wanted to go, but when I noticed a force active police force intent on bringing order and 'justice' to the galaxy, I thought it sounded a lot like the Yasanna I created. Both the species (a little) and my write up (a lot) needs to be reworked, but they do fit fairly well.
Enough that they can be fiddled into meshing, anyhow. Plus, going with my opinion that Force Organizations need an opponent, the 'terrorist group' of Dathomi (think eco-terrorists plus revolutionaries, and you'd get the worst of the Witches) fits the bill.
2. No time to suggest much, but I imagine it's a lot like a police force that supplements their forces with troops of other species. All the important officers would be hutts, of course (and a few other species as well, just to quell the equal opportunity activists). SWAT style teams would have hutt leadership, but mostly be made of other species.
3. It would vary from sector to sector. Some places they could be legally acting as the FBI, other places allow them to suppliment the local police force (read: rent-a-cop duties), etc, while other places they might be banned as police forces, but have agents operating as bounty hunters or vigilantes.
4. Witches of Dathomi

Thanks for the input. I'll take a look at the Ysanna and see what I can do with them.

Okay, using the Organizations from the Force Unleashed Campaign Guide, I wrote up one for the Ysanna/ Hutt Police. Tell me what you think.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ysanna</span>**
*"Chaos is death."* That old axiom is the heart of all Ysanna teaching. They believe that without order the galaxy would crumble, and therefore, it is their duty to spread order to the galaxy in need of it.
The Ysanna are a Force tradition and a police force. They use the Force as a tool, one with the sole purpose of helping them spread order and justice to the galaxy. To them, that is all the Force is. It is not light, not dark, not even gray. It is just a means to an end. Their Force teachings show how to use this tool, not how it works. Most Ysanna only have a rudimentary knowledge of what the Force can truly do, but they master what limited knowledge they do possess to the extent that few others can match it.
Their organization sprang from the mind of a Hutt Jedi, one who had seen what chaos could do to the galaxy. The name of this Jedi is lost to history, but the memory of his work lives on in the Ysanna. And while this organization was founded by a Hutt, and most members are Hutts, there are more than a few of different species.
They are based on the Hutt homeworld of Hutta Prime, but their influence extends across the galaxy. The Ysanna move wherever they want, brining their order to the region, whether or not the region wants it. In most areas, they are not highly regarded for this reason, but they don't do it to be popular. They do it because they think the galaxy will fall apart without them.
**Type:** Law enforcement/Force tradition
**Enemies and Allies:** The Ysanna support all law and order, as long as it conforms to their vision of it. They prefer to do their work with other law enforcement agencies, some of whom welcome the aid, and others who wish they'd go throw themselves in the nearest black hole. By the very core of their philosophy, they are opposed to all forms of lawlessness and unconformity. The Witches of Dathomi, then, are the epitome of everything they despise.
**Scale:** 15 (galactic region)
**Organization Score Criteria:** Anyone who meets the strict moral and legal requirements can join the organization, as long as they are also Force Sensitive. Even the smallest infraction can result in severe punishment or expulsion from the order, so any potential Ysanna must be willing to live with that. They only accept adults, as children cannot be expected to withstand the harsh discipline of the Ysanna.
**<span style="font-size: 1.10em;">Positive Criteria/ Organization Score Modifier</span>**
Character Level/ +1/2 Character Level
Has a talent from the Ysanna Tradition talent tree/ +1
Has Skill Focus (Use the Force) feat/ +1
Has Strong in the Force feat/ +1
Member of the Hutt Species/ +1
Has no criminal record/ +2
Thirty or more years with the Ysanna/ +1
One century or more with the Ysanna/ +2
Recommendation of a member with an Organization Score of 21+/ +1
Completes a mission for the Ysanna/ +1 per mission
Defeats Dathomi Witch in combat/ +1/4 opponent's CL (CL must be greater than character's)
Captures a Dathomi Witch/ +1/4 opponent's CL
Seizes or destroys Dathomi Witch stronghold/ +2
**<span style="font-size: 1.10em;">Negative Criteria / Organization Score Modifier</span>**
Criminal Record/ -10
Associates with a Dathmoi Witch/ -2
Allows a criminal to escape justice/ -1
**Titles, Benefits and Duties:** The Ysanna are organized into ranks ranging from a simple law enforcer all the way up to the High Lords. The ranks are organized more like a military organization than anything else, and insubordination is treated just as harshly. Junior Ysanna are expected to obey their superiors at all times in matters related to law enforcement. All Ysanna are expected to continually train to master their Force abilities, to better use them to bring order to the galaxy.
**<span style="font-size: 1.10em;">Rank/Score/ Title: Benefits and Duties</span>**
0/ 3 or lower/ **Cadet:** The lowest-rnaking Ysanna, cadets are the trainees, not yet full officers. The Ysanna will cover all licensing fees for any liscensed, restricted, or military equipment a cadet purchases while within the Ysanna's sphere of influence.
1/ 4 - 12/ **Enforcer:** The first rank of full membership, Enforcers are the standard troops of the Ysanna. While within the Ysanna's sphere of influence, they may spend a Force Point to requistion 1000 credits worth of unrestricted equipment.
2/ 12-20/ **Senior Enforcer:** The rank of senior enforcer is an honorific and carries no mechanical benefits.
3/ 21-30/ **Under Lord:** Under Lords are among the most powerful of the Ysanna. They have access to four Enforcers (nonheroic 8 ) to aid them on any official Ysanna mission.
4/ 31+/ **High Lord:** Very few people every reach the rank of High Lord of the Ysanna, and there can only be five at any one time. Collectively, they are in charge of the other Ysanna as official commanders of their forces. High Lords are granted use of their own capital ship, valued at no more than three million credits.

Looking good, but IÂ´d like to suggest a change in the positive criteria section. Remove "Brings a criminal to justice +1" and add "Has the Strong in the Force feat +2". As a Force-centered organization, I think they would place high emphasis on beings naturally strong in the Force. Also, allowing bringing a criminal to justice to give +1 point would be to kind I think, since this is something every memeber of the organization is supposed to do (as I understands it), and it would allow characters to rise in their ranks very quickly.

## Re: The Hutts

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-04 13:04:45)

That's a very good point. Bringing a criminal to justice would fall under "Completing a mission for the Ysanna" anyway. Should've seen that before. I'll change it.
Thanks.

So, BoP, mind if I submit it to the main site? I ask because the Ysanna were your idea. You should have some say in it.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 17:31:41)

Okay, here's a talent tree for the organization. What do you guys think?
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Ysanna Talent Tree</span>**
Ysanna are masters of the slugthrower and telekinesis, so it was only natural that they would combine the two. In addition to the talents described below, they may take the Insightful Aim talent from the Agent of Ossus talent tree (see page 92 of the Force Unleashed Campaign Guide).
**Force Direction**: Whenever you use a Force Point to boost a ranged attack roll with a slugthrower weapon, you may count the result as a 3 (or 4 if you have Strong in the Force) without rolling. If you do roll, you must accept the result of the roll, even if it is worse.
**Bend the Bullet:** You may fire a slug thrower weapon so that the bullet does not need to fly in a straight line to reach your target. When making a ranged attack, the bullet can move up to its range around corners, over low buildings, etc. If you cannot see your target, it is treated as having total concealment and you take a -5 penalty to your attack. As a swift action, you may make a Use the Force check against DC 25 to ignore concealment and cover with this attack.
*Prerequisite:* Force Direction
**Bullet Slam:** You can add a little extra power to your bullets, by boosting them with the Force. When you fire a slugthrower weapon, you may spend a Force Point to immediately use *Force blast* against the same target. The damage for both attacks is added together when it it applied to the target. You must decide whether you are using this talent before you make the attack roll, but you do not have to spend the Force Point if you miss your target.
*Prerequisites: Force blast*, Force Direction
**Hail of Bullets:** When using a slug thrower weapon in autofire mode, you may use the Force to spread the bullets over a wider area, at the expense of damage. You may target a 4-square-by-4-square area with your autofire attack, but you do only half damage (rounded down).
*Prerequisite:* Force Direction

not bad.
I think it would be easier to just have them be able to take the Force direction talent (which i've realised you wouldn't know, it's kotor).
It's the same, but applies to all range weapons.
I would change bend the bullet to "if you can't see the target, it's treated as having total concealment, and your attack takes a -5 penalty"
and that you may ignore cover within the bullets range if you succeed on a DC 25 use the force check

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 17:44:39)

Actually, someone did tell me about the talent, so I based it a little bit off of what they told me. Still, I don't really know anything about it, so I just made something up.
You're right, I think the total concealment would work better, so I'll change that.
As for ignoring the cover, the talent requires you to aim first. When you do so, you automatically ignore cover. I could, however, take out the aiming requirement and put in a UtF check as a swift action instead.

## Re:The Hutts

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 17:47:13)

didn't notice the aiming part, but it fits better without the aiming
but yeah, just say "force direction" and it will work better
btw, I think bullet slam's somewhat weak, maybe the damage is added together?

## Re:The Hutts

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 17:48:36)

That was the intention. I guess maybe I wasn't clear on that.

## Re:The Hutts

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 17:52:03)

well, as it stands you attack with the bullet then use force blast, which isn't very powerful, but I suppose it would be complicated to make it any other way.
like by spending a force point you may remove one use of force blast from your force suite (which counts as activating the power) and add the damage you would normally do from force blast to your slugthrower damage.

## Re:The Hutts

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 17:54:35)

That's how I intended it to work. I thought it was pretty powerful as it essentially gave you an extra standard action in the round for the cost of a Force Point.

Wow. I didn't notice this at all. Sorry about that. Yes, by all means. The Ysanna are yours, now.

When you didn't answer, I did it anyway. There's no main site now, but I've been working on a pdf file for the Kalium stuff, and I put the Ysanna in there. It's actually very slow-going, since I really don't know what I'm doing and I've had little free time in the last few weeks. But it's getting there.
