# The Vagrants (origin for Jedi and Sith)

***Designer’s Note:** I wanted to try my hand at incorporating the Jedi and Sith into Kalium. While leaving them fundamentally the same I really wanted to put a twist on where they come from, and I thought it would be good fun to turn them into intergalactic gypsies. Both are clans (yes, there’s no rule of two for the Sith here) and there’s some design space left over for minor families to also exist, which could account for the Jensaraii if we wanted to include them, or simply be used for new Jedi derivative traditions if we so choose.*

**Summary:** A Force tradition originally from Firaxia, the Soma families travel from planet to planet and place to place without ever settling. Despite their common origins the Soma have split ideologically since realising their Force potential, and the foremost among the modern clans are the Jedi and the Sith.
**History:** 
The Force is everywhere and within everything, and there is no single origin point for Force practitioners in the Galaxy. However, Firaxia is considered by many to be its spiritual home. By the time the existence of Force-users became publically known, an event which happened on Firaxia, the planet already boasted several established traditions. Among these was the Soma, an extended Firaxian bloodline who lived in familial units that travelled throughout the world, never settling. The Soma were very spiritual, and when the first among them tapped his latent Force-potential the practice soon spread throughout the bloodline.
Since the Soma family units were often isolated from each other during their travels, several different and often incompatible traditions emerged from their Force practices. Foremost among these were those established by the two largest families—the Jedi and the Sith. The Jedi saw the Force as both a path to spiritual enlightenment and a priceless asset to call upon in times of need. The Sith, under the guidance of a materialistic matriarch, saw the Force only as a powerful tool. On this matter the families clashed several times and inevitably blood was spilled and the Grudge was born. The Sith underwent ever darker practices in order to crush the Jedi who had made them lose face. For their part, the Jedi unwillingly developed arts of war to defend themselves (though, ever mindful, they incorporated these arts into their creed of enlightenment).
Predictably, it was the conflicts of the Jedi and Sith that eventually drew public attention to the Force. Several members of both families were captured and held against their will, and the Soma knew what was to come since the consequences of prejudice against a different people were fresh in their minds after the in-fighting. For the first time since the families had divided spiritually a Great Meet was called for. Quickly the matter was settled—under a temporary truce, the Soma would leave Firaxia to escape persecution, and seek their fortunes elsewhere.
In modern times, the Jedi and the Sith (and a smattering of smaller Soma families) live as they have always lived, only now they travel among the stars. The Jedi and the Sith in particular have grown stronger, having accepted Force-strong members of other lines and even other species in order to survive. They refer to themselves now as a clans, rather than families. Though their vagrant lifestyles yet remain similar, each of the two traditions have continued to develop along their ideological paths and have grown into something far more.
The Jedi see themselves as philosophers and seekers of enlightenment, who nevertheless have within them the power to protect themselves and those around them. They have somewhat formalised themselves as an order of spiritual warriors, possessed of knightly virtues, clear minds, and just souls. The Sith have become ever more hungry for power and claim that their path is the more honest one—they are just acting in their own interests using the natural strength they possess.
**Location:** The Vagrants have no settled headquarters. Each family travels in its own transport, and rarely stays in one place for too long. Once every two standard years the families of each clan meet, though the location of the meet is never settled until a few short days in advance. Very rarely, and only under extremely unusual circumstances given the rivalries existing between the clans, the entirety of the Soma come together in a Great Meet to discuss matters of grave import.
**Philosophy:** For the most part, the Jedi and Sith philosophies are unchanged from those of the existing traditions in the *Star Wars* universe. They are less formal and ritualised, however, especially on the part of the Sith.
The Jedi see it as part of their moral duty to help those in need, but they have no official sanction to intervene. As such they do not act because it is required of them, but rather choose to act when they believe it to be the right thing to do. The Jedi stress loyalty to the clan, believing that fulfilling ones moral duties to those around oneself is a necessary step on the path to enlightenment. However, a Jedi is honour-bound to disagree with other clan members if he truly feels they are acting improperly.
The Sith seek power for their clan and for themselves. They have very few qualms about illegal or immoral action, and are prepared to steal, maim, and even murder to further their goals. If there is one moral obligation the Sith do recognise it is the one they owe their clan—they have not fallen so far to entirely forget their roots. However, a self-serving Sith who sees an opportunity to act against a clan member and in so doing gain an increase in personal power will usually attempt such action. These attempts are secretly tolerated, since they remove the weak and leave only the strong. However, should a Sith be caught in the attempt, the consequences for them are dire and almost always deadly.
The Jedi and Sith are still opposed, and still clash with regularity. The Grudge is set in stone now, and there seems no realistic way of uniting two groups touting such diametrically opposed philosophies. Compromise in either case is as unlikely a concept as a rancor nursemaid.
The Soma traditionally wielded swords for self-defence, and they still practice swordplay. However, they have adapted from the weapons of old since leaving Firaxia, adopting the graceful energy blades known as lightsabers. Using the Force to augment their fighting style the Soma flows through combat as though untouchable and their lightsaber deflects incoming fire without apparent conscious thought, making them truly terrifying opponents.

Sounds like a fair description. In kalium Jedi don't have a wierd quasi do whetever you want deal with a major power and it makes sense for them all to be somewhat nomadic in their smaller numbers.
I wonder on the Sith however... Given their power sucking tendencies might not a fair proportion of them set up in a given area to take over the place? At the least even in the draft galactic histories a sith faction was able to raise an army and fleet to make a play for the galaxy - likely consisting of many disposable thralls from wherever.

True, and depending on what we actually go for with the timelines this is obviously subject to change.

I like how you did this. Very nice job. If I have time later, I'm sure I'll find something to pick apart, though. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> But I like it, I really do.
