Telepathic Tradition Talent Tree
Those who choose to focus their telepathic abilities gain great power in affecting the minds of the weak willed. Only a character with the Telepathic Training feat may take talents from this tree. These qualify as force talents (even though you donâ€™t necessarily have to be force sensitive to acquire them). Characters who can take these talents may also take the Cleanse mind and Force of Will talents (see page 24 of Force Unleashed campaign guide).
**Psychic Bastion***
You gain a +2 telepathy bonus to your will defense against mind affecting effects.
Additionally, you may use the sense surroundings aspect of the Use the Force skill untrained, even if you lack the Force Sensitive feat. This use of sense surroundings can only sense targets that are vulnerable to mind affecting effects.
**Psychic Focus**
Once per encounter, you may regain all expended once per encounter abilities in this talent tree as a swift action.
**Mind Influencer**
You have become skilled at influencing otherâ€™s thoughts and actions.
You may make untrained uses to activate the Mind Trick power, and gain a number of uses of the Mind Trick power, equal to your wisdom modifier +1 (minimum 1).
*prerequisite*: Psychic Bastion
**Mind Affecting Mastery**
You have delved deeper into the art of controlling your opponents mind.
When you take this talent, you may gain the Improved Mind Trick, or the Dominate Mind force technique. This talent may be taken twice, the second time gaining the force technique you didnâ€™t pick up the first time.

Whenever you successfully use the telepathic training feat and damage your target, by spending a force point your opponent is immobilized until the end of their next turn.
**Mental Blast**
Once per encounter, when you use the telepathic training feat, you may instead target an area with length and width equal to your charisma modifier, or a line with length equal to twice your charisma modifier. You may exclude a number of targets equal to your wisdom modifier. The Evasion talent has no effect on this ability.
*prerequisite*: Psychic Focus
**Improved Mental Attack**
Your mental attacks have become stronger. When you use the telepathic training feat, the number of damage dice rolled is increased by an amount equal to 1/4 your character level (rounded down).

You have learned how to release a powerful burst of mental energy. Once per encounter when you use the telepathic training feat, you may change the activation time to a full-round action, and you make the use the force check against all targets within 6 squares. If the result exceeds the targetsâ€™ will defense the targets take damage equal to the result of the use the force check and the targets take a penalty to attack rolls and skill checks equal to the amount your result exceeded their will defense (minimum 1, maximum 5) until the end of their next turn. You may exclude a number of targets equal to your wisdom modifier. The Evasion talent has no effect on this ability.
*prerequisites*: Mental Blast, Psychic Bastion, Psychic Focus
**Mental Fighting Mastery**
You have learned the secrets of telepathically fighting, and have many increased mental powers because of it. The damage dice of the telepathic training feat increase to d8 instead of d6.

Alternatively, you can spend a destiny point and make the activation time a reaction. As well, you may reroll any mind affecting ability that involves a use the force check, but you must take the result of the reroll, even if itâ€™s worse. Finally, you may affect characters with levels in force disciple or using the indomitable will talent with your mind affecting abilities, but they gain a +5 bonus to will defense against any of your mind affecting abilities.

**Benefit**: When you use the Telepathic Training feat and successfully exceed your target's will defense, you can spend a Destiny point and you deal extra damage equal to your use the force check result, and if the damage moves the target down the condition track, the condition becomes persistent.
Telepaths are any person who uses their mind to affect other people's minds. While few species have access to telepathic abilities, those that do have a very dangerous ability to tap into. Telepathy allows you to control minds, influence thoughts, and actually attack someone through their thoughts, causing physical damage to their body or brain from your thoughts. Many people dismiss telepathy as folk lore, but those that see it in action learn how powerful it is. Telepathy is also an ability force sensitives possess, and while few force users focus solely on telepathic abilities, those that do turn their minds into incredibly dangerous weapons.

**Psylan**
Long ago, many species discovered their telepathic abilities. Many found them difficult to control, or fell to the dark side from having such power at their command. A wise Draethos, Quermians, Hortek, and Iktotchi came together and founded an organization to help train those with telepathic abilities in how to control them. They called this group the Psylan. The Psylan gained great prestige in acting as judges, as they could determine the innocence of an individual with a single thought. The Psylan also gained a reputation as powerful fighters, as their mental abilities defeated conventional armor and shields. The Psylans were devastated during the Great War, as many factions banded together and defeated the Psylan with pure overwhelming force. The Psylans have sense recovered, though not to their former status. The current headquarters of the Psylan is Itoka, the home of the Iktotchi.

Let's start with the talent tree. While allowing the telepaths to access some Force powers is not a bad idea, also allowing Force users to access this talent tree is a bad idea, IMO. They would be able to use talents and feats to gain Force powers, which might be too unbalancing.
Two, Thought Wave Explosion and Mental Blast are not clear from the text that they are area attacks.
Third -- and this is entirely a taste issue on my part -- I don't care for some of the talent names. WOTC also does this (I mean, what's up with Force Direction?), and I'd have no objection if you felt like changing Mind Influencer, Mind Affecting Mastery, or Hold in Place. Still, it's not really that big a deal.

Okay, onto the Organization. I like it, mostly. There's something off about it, but I'm not sure exactly what. I'll think about it, but it may just be me.
There are two things I do know. One, the Ysanna would love them. I mean, what's not to like about a telepath?
> Ysanna: &quot;Is he guilty?&quot;
> Psylan (after reading mind): &quot;Yes.&quot;
> Ysanna executes man.

Why bother with a trial?
Two, I don't get the build lightsaber ability thing. How can you use it with other melee weapons?

hmm, well they do have to take the telepathic training feat, and also only get mind trick and fear from this talent tree. mind trick is useful, but having 2-5 uses of it isn't that great.
Fear, is very darkside, also means they are not strengthening lightsaber combat as much.
Thought Wave Explosion and Mental blast are area effects, but evasion does not help you against them.
If you come up with better names for the talents, I'll be happy to change them. I don't like many of the names myself.

the build lightsaber ability allows you to build a lightsaber and then attune it with a force point. The point was to allow a Mind Mage to build ANY melee weapon with it, rather than just lightsabers.

Ah, okay. That makes sense.

I didn't see where the "lightsaber thing" was listed but...I dunno, allowing any weapon to be attuned like a Jedi attunes a lightsaber takes away from a possible uniqueness of this group. I'd rather see them use a particular weapon.
But that's just me.
