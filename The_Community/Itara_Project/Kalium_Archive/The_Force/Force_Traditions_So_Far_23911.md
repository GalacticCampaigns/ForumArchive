# Force Traditions So Far

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-04-13 15:59:48)

Just a quick and easy place to list all the Force Tradiations. I encourage a separate thread for each, so the details of each tradition can be hashed out. I just want a single place to go to when hunting for them all.
*(descriptions- along with everything else on this page) will change at the author's request)*

I think that's it so far. Though, the link for the Ysanna isn't quite set up right.

I think the Hapan SPD aren't good enough or big enough to be called special ops proper :P
And I'm thinking of renaming a lot of things if certain fundamentals of the galaxy are nailed down -_-

I just want to post this as a clarification:
I Can't / Won't consider a Force Tradition approved until it has been rewritten to match the format I've requested. This is solely for the sake of uniformity.
