# Force in the Galaxy

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-27 15:16:44)

I have been kicking around a few timeline ideas, and that got thinking...
We want several large Force Traditions, right? I originally started out with six, strongly defined groups (or rather, intended to be strongly define, later) but then we got more than I had planned for. I started thinking about each tradition, and all that, and I kept seeing almost the same thing. At least from the light side/dark side aspect, most of 'our' traditions are just like the Jedi, only with less restrictions.
Now, what it takes to go dark is a huge aspect of the Force, so I think it's important to consider.
As far as I can tell, in the Lucas-verse, there are three things that cause a character to go dark: killing some one (justified or not is another long discussion best done somewhere else), doing harm to some one (torture), and using the Force with strong emotions (strangely, no one ever has become dark by using the Force when happy...).
So...do we want to change these? Are the above merely mental constructs that help keep the Force User sane (like the Vampire: the Masquerade's Paths)? Are the actually the (a?) definition of what is good?
Generally speaking, the latter is what Star Wars is about. If this is the case- as far as yawl are concerned- then perhaps those creating a new traditions might replace the third restriction (no using Force while having strong emotion) with their own. This will help define the tradition, and make everyone not be so Jedi-ish.
This might lead to another discussion; should the restriction be 'do something' or 'don't do something'? "Enforce the Laws" is a lot different than "Don't Break the Laws". But for right now, I'm asking about the third (or other) restriction on not becoming evil.

Iâ€™ve seen the Force has been used but â€œgoodâ€ guys to maim torture, kill individuals and masses, intrude into the thoughts of others to better manipulate them. To me, going by individual acts removes any consistency when trying to interpret and morals with The Force.
To me, dark side tendencies have been portrayed as an individual seeking power for its own sake (compensation much). It may start out as seeking power to balance the perceived power of others that are abusing it, or to maintain the status quo from some perceived fall (usually that is a falsehood constructed by others gathering power for themselves for its own sake), but ultimately itâ€™s a matter of power corrupting. Having that much power in one individual ends up distorting said mind and makes that mind behave in a self destructive fashion which, eventually, results in that individual being taken down there-by redistributing said power to the masses. This is how itâ€™s happened in the movies and books (that Iâ€™ve read anyway).
I was interested in seeing something different in the portrayals of Force in Kalium so as to set it apart from GFFA(Galaxy Far Far Away ie Cannon). I had mentioned a flip of the power structure, namely the free flowing of force is what distorted the minds of Jedi. What was seen as good in GFFA was actually toxic in Kalium and visa versa. Binding the Force into constructs, imposing form and function upon it like the Sith constructs, are what allowed for stabilized use.
Taking Jedi as they are in GFFA into Kalium would result in rampaging religious zealots bent on the imposing of natural order. Taking Sith as they are in GFFA into Kalium would result in Force users familiar with form and structure and are able to use the Force while maintaining their sanity and creations like Sith swords, and other force run techno sorcery would be similar to the meditative forms as portrayed for Vulcans. The individual acts would be portrayed as such; Balance, Infinite diversity in infinite combinations, etc.
This would allow for something similar to but apart from GFFA which, as I understood, was the entire point of Kaliums existence. It would still be portrayed as extreme emotions distorting the Force and therefore becoming toxic to the weilders but acts to enforce the balance and control portrayed differently. Still "The Force" just "ala Kalium".
Otherwise, as has been mentioned, all you get is something that looks much like a bad copy of GFFA. I didnâ€™t get much feedback when I suggested it originally but I figured Iâ€™d try again. Thanks for your patience.

My opinion always has been, and will continue to be: Get rid of the old Dark Side/Light Side of the Force ideas, and introduce the "grey" philosophy or whatever you want to call it. The Force is the Force - Neutral. It has no sides, and the only place the Dark Side exists is in ones emotions and character.

IMO, those are just guidelines invented by the Jedi Order that goes with their philosophy and view of the Force. To quote my favorite Jedi "Remember, abilities are not inherently good or evil, it's how you use them". The reason the Sith encourages the use of strong emotions to channel the Force is because such powerful feelings makes it easier to summon the tremendous power needed to shape a bolt of lightning or extreme telekinetic powers, but it can also be done by characters with calm, peaceful minds. Just look at Yoda. ItÂ´s just like when you get really anrgy or scared, you can push yourself to extreme efforts.

I like this whole paragraph. Go figure.

To keep the Star Wars feel, I wanted to keep the good guy and bad guy thing. Good and Evil, light and dark. Going too much Grey gives a lot of folks with power that isn't paid for. I want a price, even if it's not a very painful one. And it mases everyone even more the same.

This one line makes me wanna curse. Not only because it ruins a very cool mad raving I had, but it makes sense. Stop it.

This strikes me as too much focused on the end result. Bad Guy was a Good Guy, but got a bunch of power, and then turned evil. This would mean all Good Guys needed to stay lower power, least they become evil.
Which is an interesting idea. But not...maybe...I dunno. Have to think about it.

I was one of those who ignored this idea, not at all liking the way it tasted. But now...now I am looking at it again, and its making more sense. I'll look at it more, and see what I can do.

This I disagree with. When one thinks of the military, one does not think of an individual Soldier. When one thinks of a tradition, one does not think of a single practitioner. The only time anyone thought 'Jedi' and that was one person, it was when Skywalker was the only one. I want something to use to model the traditions & the rest of the Force with, and not deal with the individuals. Hard rules in which the traditions must obey to, so there is a price for their power.
Tired. Going to bed. Thanks for the input.

Wow I go away for two days and I have this whole conversation to catch up on. Forgive me if I'm repeating someone else.

This is my favorite idea of the ones that have been proposed. Every Force tradition is different in their approach to the Force. One group achieves their connection trough serenity, another chooses emotion; one follows their heart, another their head. These are fundamental differences, but no one is better than another. They lend themselves to different uses, but being different doesn't mean one has to be evil and the other good.
I don't think we should get rid of the Dark Side/Light Side either. Doing so will only make it just another system of magic. The dark side is what is so distinctive about the Force. And I don't think having a different dark side for every tradition is a good idea, either. It makes the Force seem arbitrary -- it's only dark if someone says it is.
How we handle the Dark Side/Light Side dichotomy is another matter. Here's a thought. In the Lucas-verse, it's assumed that the light side is the default side. What if it isn't? What is everyone starts off on the dark side and if they aren't careful, they become good? That really sounds bizarre to me, and I don't know if it'll work, but it's an idea.

While I have no problem having power corrupting, if only the bad guys can get strong, who's going to fight them? If good is naturally weaker, the whole galaxy will turn evil in time. You need a counteracting force. I don't know about anyone else, but having a "No Good Allowed" galaxy sounds like a very bad idea.

That's not a bad idea, but I still like the idea of each tradition handling it differently. "Free-flowing" doesn't really exist in the Lucas-verse, because the Jedi had to be calm to hear the Force. There is alway a stop, something that prevents the Force from acting all by itself, but that stop will differ with every tradition.

I was never saying that we do away with the distinction of Dark/Light Side, but I sure could do without the strange notion that certain powers are "more evil" than others. Really, how come you are guaranteed to increase your Dark Side Score by frying someone with a bolt of lightning, but if you pummel him to death with small rocks, you might just get away with it, depending on a GM call?
ItÂ´s like I read in a Jedi Counseling back in the RCR days, a GM asking about his players who wanted to use Force Light on each other to constantly get rid of their Dark Side Points. The Counselor said that it might be doable once, but more than that and he said to actually give them another Dark Side Point since they werenÂ´t really seeking redemption, just a way to keep "clean". Quite a good example of the "Powers arenÂ´t inherently good or evil, itÂ´s how you use them" saying.
However, even if we do agree that this is how the Force fundamentally works, that doesnÂ´t mean that everyone in the galaxy has to understand this, or accept such a thinking, but they might still hold to the same knuckle-headed beliefs of the Jedi in the GFFA.

Well, to continue on what IÂ´ve been saying in this discussion, why must there be a "default" side? I say leave it to the character. If he acts evil and does evil things, then he is evil. If he does good things and act good, he is a good guy.

Every "Dark Sider" was motivated by rage and vengence and seeking death an domination for opponents. Shoving too much power through thereby distorting the wielder. Seems to me more of a removal of competition action for a lazy force wielder. If there was a force to work against you push yourself against it, if not, why bother?

They seem to be very parallel to Jedi in many many ... many ways. Denial of their darker nature, rather than acknowledgment and balance, wreaks all sorts of havok with them the same as if they let their darker natures rule them. Said havoc, especially the later, usually results in their expiration. Same as before: as long as we keep that, whatever else we do is still the Force as far as I'm concerned.

Regarding the nature of the Force...
This can be a tricky one. I do believe I came to the conclusion. This should actually settle a lot of potential dispute it you take it to heart when deciding how the Force behaves with regards to Light and Dark Sides. Imagine, if you will, that the "sides" of the Force are like a pendulum or thermometer.
At the extreme right or high temperature, you have fierce anger and impassioned love, fiery emotions that tend to run roughshod over your sensibilities. Anakin was a prime example of someone of this nature, and he did good acts as well as evil. In fact, even Mace Windu struggled with this aspect of his personality. At the extreme left or very low temperature, you have cold, calculating, and callous behavior. Count Dooku, once a respected Jedi trained by Master Yoda himself, embraced the Dark Side through this extreme. Depa Billaba did as well. I don't know for certain, but I think Jacen Solo went this route, and so did Mara Jade until she turned good.
In the middle range where the pendulum would rest if it didn't swing or at a comfortable temperature where water would be liquid and life could readily prosper, is the Light Side. The mentally balanced approach rich in serenity and self control. The middle road. Naturally, this is difficult. When something distasteful or particularly enjoyable happens, people react. They want to rid themselves of it or stay as close to it for as long as possible. The Light Side is about moderation, self control, and serenity. Obviously, characters like Yoda would be prime examples.
But, you have to realize, in both of these cases, their relevance only actually applies when a Force Sensitive person actually uses the Force. Her behavior and feelings are what influence the ephemeral energy to color her own spirit Light or Dark. The Force itself doesn't care. It's like asking the ocean if it cares about the Gulf Stream or the whirlpools during tidal changes. Or the times when the water clear and placid and welcoming. The Force itself is neutral, it swings from side to side as the currents of time and sentience act upon it.
If you can accept that explanation of the Force, then maybe I can take you one step further. Maybe you can accept the idea that a Light Side Force Sensitive cannot be evil but doesn't have to be good. On the other hand, a Dark Side Force Sensitive doesn't have to be evil, but if they slip too far and lose sight of the good, they will be. Naturally, good and evil follow classical explanations. Good is self sacrifice and helping others. Evil is self aggrandizing and either malicious or callous. If these ideas seem plausible, then I can bring in the last point I have regarding the nature of the Force and the natural progression of Force talents (not game mechanics, just a mental exercise regarding the abilities I see within the Force).
The natural state of life is competition. It may seem peaceful sometimes, but it's most definitely not. Look at a jungle in the bright light of day. The plants are vibrant green, the birds singing and monkeys chattering. It seems all happy. But you know what's going on. Those animals are competing for mating rights, fending off intruders to their turf for feeding rights. And all the while, predators are hunting down their next meal. When they fail at these tasks, they become angry, aggressive, dangerous. The snake may not be angry when he fails to catch the bird, but he wouldn't mind eating the bird's chicks instead. There is passion in what the animals do. And passion is Dark. It's easy, too, as it's very natural. Sentient species are much the same. It's easier to get angry and use that strength and adrenaline to get something done rather than to stop and take a breath and center oneself (especially without previous training or experience). Fear of loss, fear in general, can help you defend your mate, your children, or your cause. These intense feelings are natural. To call on them when using the Force is easy, and will likely provide results (Yoda even says as much). But it's Dark. But it's not evil. But there is a limit. You can only go only so far on passion and you can only embrace so much on cold calculation. It's easy, but it's not infinite.
Peace and self control are not exactly the natural state of things. Even the immovable mountains are subject to the unrelenting elements until they are worn to the ground. On the other hand, when you are in control of yourself, you can see things for what they are. You can appreciate the truest nature of your obstacles and address them with calm precision. This is different from cold calculation, one as such don't stop to take into account what their obstacle is, only that it is an obstacle and must be addressed. The passionate one would see an obstacle and hammer through it. The peaceful one would not only see the obstacle, but use it as a means to grow and in fact make the obstacle more than just an interruption (oftentimes turning the obstacle into an ally and making it grow as well). Such an approach leads to perpetual growth and allows many to thrive. It's just not easy, not anywhere near as easy or intuitive as the Dark Side is.
With this set of thoughts in mind, perhaps you can better explore the nature of the Force and what types of Force traditions would blossom under such a system. I'll stop here and see where you guys go with it before continuing with my ideas regarding the evolution of Force traditions across the Star Wars Universe. Maybe later I'll explain why I think the Jedi became what they did and how they were wiped out so frakkin' many times.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-23 17:46:45)

Yeah, that was some reading. Let me offer some complementing thoughts from my side, although IÂ´ve probably already stated much of it before.
The Force doesnÂ´t matter, at least not primarily, on the whole Light/Dark side. Light and Dark is not sides of the Force, but sides of people (including non-Force Sensitives). On the Light side, you have peaceful, creative emotions, such as compassion, love and empathy. On the Dark side is the destructive emotions, such as anger, fear and agression. Both sides can be equally destructive to someone, if taken to their extremes, and if the feelings are allowed to control you, instead of the other way around. The pathway to true power should thus, naturally, lie in the middle, where you keep all emotions in check, light and dark.
Using the Force can be done in various ways, but in either way, your emotional state matters. "Dark Siders" brings the Force in line, makes it obey their commands using the raw power coming from their darker emotions, as such emotions usually result in great surges of strength, unlike what the "Light" emotions can accomplish. "Light Siders" allows the Force to flow through them by keeping their emotions in check, and not fighting it, but still nudges it along its path to accomplish their desired goals. Hence the Light can be seen as the "natural" order of things, as those who use it can accomplish much of what they want simply by opening themselves more to it, while those who follow darker paths has to subdue it to their wills.
The failure of many who follows their darker emotions, is that they let them control them in their quest for power. A Sith Lord might give himself fully into his hatred to draw strength from the "Dark Side" of the Force, thus losing other things, such as his patience, clarity of mind or other things. One who manages to summon his rage to give him strength, but keeps it in check, not to lose himself in it, becomes a far more powerful being. The same goes for those who follows the light.

This argument is precisely the one I want you to avoid when thinking of the Force in the manner I presented. The way you have it, the Light is good and the Dark is evil/bad. Love is good, despite that it's one of the best routes to jealousy. Compassion and empathy can both lead to fear of loss. Fear is a natural response, and it'll save your bacon in many cases. Aggression, too. Don't think of Light and Dark as two ends of the same stick.
Light is not about the "good" emotions, it's about the moderation of one's emotions. Dark is not about the "bad" emotions, it's about the extremes of feeling. Hence my analogy of a pendulum. Light is not tick, nor tock, it is the quiet in between. The Force makes no distinctions between the "positive" emotions of love and "negative" emotions of anger, or other respective examples. The Force merely notes the intensity of those emotions, and it's the measure of intensity that is the measure of Light (warm or cool) and Dark (hot or cold).
If you think of it in this as the heart of the Force reflected in life, I think you'll find everything else you believe about the Force falls into place rather well. Again, I waited until ungodly o'clock to actually post, so more will come later.

Apreciate the effort Xychotic & I find that what you detail fits with the presentation of the Force in movies and books very well. In the cannon and non of SW it seems to me that it's the extremes, whatever their form, that cause individual or groups of force users to fall. When the wielders become crazed with the power the Force provides over others is also where it seems the falls take place. A companion to that, to me, is when the weilder loses sight of the power the Force provides them to work symbiotically with others and instead wield it over the will of others.

On the Light side, you have peaceful, creative emotions, such as compassion, love and empathy. On the Dark side is the destructive emotions, such as anger, fear and aggression. Both sides can be equally destructive to someone, if taken to their extremes, and if the feelings are allowed to control you, instead of the other way around. The pathway to true power should thus, naturally, lie in the middle, where you keep all emotions in check, light and dark.

This argument is precisely the one I want you to avoid when thinking of the Force in the manner I presented. The way you have it, the Light is good and the Dark is evil/bad. Love is good, despite that it's one of the best routes to jealousy. Compassion and empathy can both lead to fear of loss. Fear is a natural response, and it'll save your bacon in many cases. Aggression, too. Don't think of Light and Dark as two ends of the same stick.

Actually, no, I havenÂ´t said that Light/Dark is Good/Evil. Both sides can be equally virtuous, and both can be equally devastating, if taken to their extremes. But both are *natural*, and both must exist in all living things, as is the nature of all living things. The reason they might be looked upon as Good/Evil is because Creative/Destructive feelings might be looked upon that way, and are often harnessed by Good/Evil people respectively.
The Force makes no distinctions, thatÂ´s right, because it has no sides, and simply *is*. But, certain emotional states makes it easier to channel the Force in certain ways. For example, Force Lightning are most easily summoned by the sheer brute force produced by anger and hatred. But it can also be summoned by someone who can produce and equal amount of energy and control in other ways, however this tends to be much harder. Just as it is easier to settle in and raise a defense against an attack (Force Defense) with a calm and peaceful mind, than it is if you are blinded by rage, but once again, someone with enough control over the energy of his rage and himself can do it.
Point to add, if someone missed it, these are just my ideas and thoughts, but there are support for them in the SW Galaxy.

Find me an expert that says one thing, and I'll find 10 that say the exact opposite.
I think were are looking at this the wrong way. Instead of deciding what the Force is and does in the Lucus-verse, we should focus on what it is in the Kalium-verse. Having a place to start is one thing, but let's not get into deep metaphysical discussions of a fiction religion/energy source of some one else's creation.
Yeah, um, focus on a fictional religion/energy source of *our* creation.
My thoughts on the subject:
The Force having a light side and dark side is pretty much a given in a Star Wars based setting, just like lightsabers. Gotta have it. Exactly what makes the dark side dark, or a light side light is a strange image. Strong emotions have always been bad, but everyone focuses on the negative emotions. Killing non-bad people has always been a dark act, as was torture (Force assisted or not). Direct damage with the Force is the same way. But lying, betraying, and other forms of dishonorable behavior has never mattered. I never saw a Jedi refuse to gang up on a bad guy because "that just wasn't done". Letting something happen never gave anyone a Dark Side point (that I heard of). Failing to save people (even though you tried) never amounted a drift into a dark side either.
Insanity was a sign of a the dark side, or perhaps just the herald to it. But I think I remember reading about crazy force users who were still light siders.
I do see the point that an individual choices are the heart of light and dark, good and evil, but we need a solid boundaries in order to allow for that. Using the force to inflict damage has always been a dark act, even if it is to help save millions. I have no idea why, but that was the way it was. I thought it had to do with the Force protecting that which comes from (flows from all living things, etc) but then again, the dark side is part of the Force, and those that are evil tend to wipe out millions anyhow. But, using the Force to make you a better combatant was always allowed, and even encouraged. So, you can't use Lighting to smite your foes but can slay them with a lightsaber you are whirling with Force enhanced speed and strength? What about Move object? I can't choke some one out with it, but I can pull a grenade pin. Or can I?
In the Lucas-verse, we see a lot of the negative emotions leading to the dark side, usually spawned from good emotions (jealousy from love, fear from compassion, hatred from trust). But what do *we* want. We have to have a light and dark. Does it mean good and bad? Not necessarily in that order. If you see the Force as a blazing sun in the desert, bound to bring madness before death, a bit of cooling shade might be in order.
What if the Force wasn't serenity? What if it was rage, and thundering, and lighting and if you gave in, if you went with the flow, you're passion would lead you to do truly horrible things? You would need hammer the Force into submission, dole it out in measure amounts, force it into the shape you wanted. Treat it like an expolision, and you controlled which value opened.
Stealing from the Wheel of Tim here, but the Force could be fouled or even painful to use. It could hurt to use, requiring either strong self-control or strong passion to use. You can ignore pain when your angry, but it's harder to ignore when you are calm.
Swinging back toward the Lucas-verse, using the Force flows from living things. The light side be promoting life, and the dark side promoting non-life. Mercy killings would be bad, but keeping slave wouldn't been. Chopping down trees bad, shutting off the hyderdrive is good (at first). Torture is okay (as long as he's alive when yer done) and using droids is a forgivable sin.
My thoughts are wandering here, so I'll reign them in. We have multiple traditions. We have good and bad. We should figure out if each tradition has things that make them good and bad in the eyes of the Force, or not. If so, what are they. If they don't, we need to figure out what separates on tradition from the next, and why they don't mix all the time.
My thoughts and all that.

I agree that the Force having two sides is the way it is portrayed in the Lucasverse, but not that it has to be given in any SW setting. There are plenty of other wievs of the Force presented in the Lucasverse, however only as minor ones, such as the Aing-Ti, the Falanassi and many more.
I wonÂ´t go into again what constitues as being Dark/Light, that IÂ´ve already covered.

Indeed, I would believe Kazdan Paratus qualifies. But I would disagree that insanity has anything to do with the Force at all.

Once again a clear sign that Light/Dark should have nothing to do with the Force. If we just look at it from a moral point of view, it isnÂ´t that hard to see why killing someone is a bad act, is it? And, if seen that way, it allows for more freedom on the part of characters and GMs to run things as they want, and allow for more complex moral issues on the subjects of motive and redemption.
Killing someone without hatred, anger or vengeance in your heart, but perhaps only out of necessity (the tyrant had to be stopped before slaying countless millions), might be enough to justify your actions, but the risk of growing too detatched might be even greater, causing you to fall even further.

ThatÂ´s one way to go, but with your first suggestion, you have essentially just flipped everything around, making the Dark the "normal" instead of the Light. The second one is also a way, but it would effectively put an end to playing a character who just "dabbled" in the Force, and just used it in a casual, "nothing special" manner.

Uhm, not sure I agree with any of your examples here, and I also donÂ´t like putting things in the "this you can do" and "this you canÂ´t" lists.

CanÂ´t really suggest anything on this, as in my view, the Force has no "eyes", and donÂ´t distinguish people. But figuring out what separates them should come pretty natural as we develop our traditions, as you can see why they donÂ´t get along based on differences in philiosphies. No need to put extra effort into it.

Awesome. So we are cooking with Cirsco now.

I disagree, here. Yeah, there are other ways of looking at the Force, but nearly all of them had those that became warped and evil (dark siders) and all sought out 'peace and serenity' as the 'proper' way to use the Force. Even the Aing-Ti (freakin' ungodly powerful species that only exist as a huge McGruffin...this is my thoughts on them) required "detachment", "centering themselves", and "surrendering their emotions to the Force" to use their powers, which sounds very Jedi.
Several of the minor tradiations feel like they were created because the author was thinking "shooting lighting is *cool!* Good guys should shoot lighting too!" Or dress in something other than peasant robes, or any other the other things that Jedi did to be ascetic monks. Thus, my prejudice against minor traditions.

No need to put extra effort into it.

I think we need more than lines of thought separating our traditions, but I may be out voted. I don't want our Force Users treated like mages and wizards in D&D and Shadowrun (doesn't watter who or what they are, just shoot them first).
Traditions could just be a form of 'mental constructs' through which the user manipulates the Force. Perhaps using the Force requires some sort of filter or frame work to limit the user. After all, the Force is freakin' everywhere and in everything and effecting all of it at once, right? Plugging some one up to that could be like pushing a fire hose into an ant. So people created- by accident or on purpose- something to filter it. Otherwise, it would be too much to fast for mere mortals to handle. Slipping out of that framework or not using the filter leads one to the 'dark side'. Which, instead of being evil, may be madness or violent self-combustion.
Which makes me wonder if there is a non-violent form of self-combustion...
...
So, we have **DarthAnthrax**'s view that- and correct me if I am wrong- that we should not have light and dark, merely a set of powers. Remove the dark side points and let the characters do as they do. Good and evil are defined by ones intent (murder in self-defense is cool, and that *might* include a preemptively killing some one). Difference between traditions is a roleplaying aspect, and should not touch the rules.
We have my view in that every Corce User follows a code, and that breaking the code leads to the dark side (which is either evil, maddess, or something like that). Using certain powers certain ways breaks the code, and thus leads to the dark side. Each path should have a solid set of 'sins' that breaks the code, no matter what (list might have minor and major infractions). Each tradition deals directly with the rules (as in, this tradition doesn't have access to this power, and if you break the code, you get dark side points).
We have the Lucas view that...well, watch the movies.
We have the EU view which...well...um. Yeah. It varies from author to author, and sometimes within the same author, and even sometimes in the same book.
What else do we have?
I will say this: I have my views on what is the proper way to do this, but this isn't just my product. I will take whatever is decided and run with it. If **DarthAnthrax** sways all to his side- and knowing that evil so-and-so's desire to thwart me at every turn, he will- I will write up the Force as a primal power uncaring on it's users actions. But I do want this to have as much input as possible, as the Force is very important to anything built off of Star Wars.

So more of a Dark Approach. Seduction of power etc. It's not a question of a kind of force but a kind of use of it. That's my take on it's presentation.

Whoa, whoa, hold it right there. IÂ´ve never even begun to go into how anything would be changed mechanically, IÂ´ve merely stated the philosophy and thoughts behind it. But yes, I donÂ´t think we need to have rules that say "you guys thinks differently because..."
I also have to say that when you spell it out like that, I **strongly** dislike your ideas. Having each Force user have his own "checklist" of things he canÂ´t do strikes me as very weird.
"Okay, I canÂ´t use these powers, and I canÂ´t use these powers in these ways, because then IÂ´ll be irreversibly fallen, but otherwise I can do pretty much what I want" ThatÂ´s pretty much how I read your view, correct me if IÂ´m wrong. For example, what happens if someone studies from multiple traditions, or is that completely forbidden?
If I am to suggest something mechanical, hereÂ´s a suggestion: Remove the automatic DSS increases for using certain powers, but have them retain their [Dark Side] descriptor for the purpose of talents etc. You can possibly even remove all automatic DSS increases, and leave the decision when and if to increase the DSS to the GM. Fact is a characters DSS does very little.

My thought process is "You guys think different, so this..." It's the order of things, what leads to the other. That for this, not this for that. Some days, that's important.

Heh. What's funny about that is a checklist of what you can and can't do is in every major real life religion. And yeah, it's weird.
But like real life religions, these checklists have reasons behind them, either by tradition, universal morals, or whatever. Our religions- because that's what Force Traditions are-will have stories and fables and histories and dogmas and everything else. All of this culminates into their belief structure, which dictates what is right and wrong in *their tradition*. And I stand by the idea that violating one's belief structure leads to a break down in self, and in Star Wars, that leads to evil.
***Important Point:*** I don't really want a list per user. I want one item per tradition. Jedi can't use the Force while feeling strong emotion or it breaks their code. Ysanna can't use their power to break the law. Sith can't use their powers without emotion. The Witches can't use their power to empower technology. Doing any of these results in a breach of their faith, and they gain a dark side point (or whatever). Rules light, because this is Saga. Nothing explicitly spelled out, and something that can be taken in degrees, so as to suit various gamemasters and individual actions.

For example, what happens if someone studies from multiple traditions, or is that completely forbidden?

I would rather have it be incredibly difficult, if not outright forbidden. Well, forbidden socially, difficult by the rules. Each tradition is out there is a complete mindset, a religion, a tradition. Most users grew up in their respective school of thought. To change the way you think so completely can happen, but it's hardly common or easy. In Star Wars history, those that managed are named, recognizable characters, and not just another nobody. Jacen Solo, Luke Skywalker, and the Emperor are theo nly ones I know of, for example.
Also, in real life, once you've crossed the moral boundary line, you are exactly what you described. When some one gains the 'evil' title in real life, he is a serial killer, a rapist, etc. Who cares if he steals DVD players in his spare time? Another example is the TV show Supernatural, where those that went over to evil, embraced their darkside, experienced a rapid rise in power. It's a common theme in Star Wars that those who 'fall' gain power very quickly. And the lack of restrictions- moral or otherwise- opens up a host of advantages to the bad guy.

Very true, but it is a measure of a character going evil (and into NPC status). It does limit a character's action, and player's choices. It enforces- mildly- that Star Wars is a place of heroes and not villains. Powers that bring dark side points are those that are considered evil. Should they be treated that way in the Kalium galaxy? Not if we change what gains a dark side point. The Witches would have easy access to the lighting powers, and can use nature's wrath without a bit of evil in their bones, but the Jedi, who empower their damaging powers with emotion, cannot.
But... moving on. Can you spell out what you want? I understand opinions will change, new facts and ideas crop up, and not everything you take fro granted will be apparent to everyone else, but if we should have something to work with. Are you good with the 'no dark side points for anything but evil acts'? Or is there other, fundamental things that should be adjusted?

I thought I had already posted enough, seeing as I think we should decide on the nature and philosophy of the Force before starting to decide on mechanics.

Well, everything that you need to know about why people donÂ´t get along should already be there in their descriptions already. If you see two traditions that has completely opposite views of the Force, my guess is that they wouldnÂ´t get along. Same if one thinks they should use the Force to guide and help the rest of the Galaxy, and one thinks they should isolate themselves, pondering the mysteries of the Force, I could see some arguments arise between them.

Yeah, and no guess, religions are also masters of squirming out of those same checklists at will. Thou shall not kill - Except for when you need to force your faith upon someone, a slave has misbehaved, or someone arguments your beliefs. But please, leave any religious discussion out of this, as IÂ´m no fan of religion at all.
My point being, itÂ´s not that simple as you can just say "these things are bad, donÂ´t do them". First, it actually wouldnÂ´t be a list, itÂ´d be a pretty huge library if you were to cover everything. And if you donÂ´t cover everything, you get people who has a short number of things they canÂ´t do, but an unlimited number of things they *can* do, and most importantly, can use to go around the few taboos they do have.

Jacen Solo, Luke Skywalker, and the Emperor are theo nly ones I know of, for example.
Also, in real life, once you've crossed the moral boundary line, you are exactly what you described. When some one gains the 'evil' title in real life, he is a serial killer, a rapist, etc. Who cares if he steals DVD players in his spare time? Another example is the TV show Supernatural, where those that went over to evil, embraced their darkside, experienced a rapid rise in power. It's a common theme in Star Wars that those who 'fall' gain power very quickly. And the lack of restrictions- moral or otherwise- opens up a host of advantages to the bad guy.
Well, first of all, I simply agree with the idea that it should be "socially forbidden, difficult by the rules". It seems like you are saying that everyone should be raised and indoctrinated with whatever tradition they happen to be born in so that even listening to the thoughts of an "outsider" could be enough to shatter their whole world. Basically, whatÂ´s wrong with having traditions being what they are now, to quote the Jedi Training Manual, "Affiliated Programs"?

Fact is a characters DSS does very little.

Very true, but it is a measure of a character going evil (and into NPC status). It does limit a character's action, and player's choices. It enforces- mildly- that Star Wars is a place of heroes and not villains. Powers that bring dark side points are those that are considered evil. Should they be treated that way in the Kalium galaxy? Not if we change what gains a dark side point. The Witches would have easy access to the lighting powers, and can use nature's wrath without a bit of evil in their bones, but the Jedi, who empower their damaging powers with emotion, cannot.
But... moving on. Can you spell out what you want? I understand opinions will change, new facts and ideas crop up, and not everything you take fro granted will be apparent to everyone else, but if we should have something to work with. Are you good with the 'no dark side points for anything but evil acts'? Or is there other, fundamental things that should be adjusted?
OK, IÂ´ll try to write down as complete a description of my thoughts as possible (even though I think IÂ´ve posted it more than twice already), including examples, paralells and even mechanics. In the meantime, read up on The Potentium, The Unifying Force as well as the beliefs of Jolee Bindo and Jacen Solo.

### **Xychotic** (2009-06-25 17:15:44)

Regarding Force Traditions...
I have to preface this by saying that I don't use Saga, so what I say may be difficult for those that do to implement, but that is not the topic I wish to explore. The way I have it, there are 8 different facets of the Force (at least as understood by the Jedi):
* Clairvoyance (Farseeing/Remote Viewing, but strictly in real time),
* Energy Control (Force Lightning and manipulation of energy in the form of heat, cold, chemical, and electrical, but not kinetic),
* Heal (self explanatory)
* Kill (not telekinetic, more like psychoapoptis... or psychonecrosis, either way, spontaneous force based death of the organic body in question)
* Mindtrick (covering mental influence, from sensory illusion to the illusion that what the Jedi orders is a great idea and should be pursued immediately)
* Prescience (sensing events of the past and future, separate from clairvoyance because it is incredibly powerful and deserving its own category)
* Telekinesis (if I have to explain this one, you need to get out from under that rock and look around)
* Telepathy (includes communication, connection, and rooting around but not influencing like Mindtrick)
Additional learning on my part indicated that the following are also possible
* Mindblade (a power of my construction that I had used to augment my weapons seems to have precedent within SW)
* Teleportation (used only by the Aing Tii monks, as far as I know)
Now, a Force Tradition should not be viewed strictly as an exploration of how the Force might be used, but instead as a philosophical/religious organization that might actually have proof as to the phenomena/miracles that it claims fall under its dogma. â€œHow the Force is meant to interact with those beliefs, and how the adherents embrace the Force?â€ becomes the primary question when crafting a Force Tradition. For instance, the Jedi are known to be a cross between Wild West marshals, Shaolin monks, and samurai. Unfortunately, the Sith are long doomed to merely be the ugly stepbrother of the Jedi in that they are measured almost entirely by how they are the opposite of the Jedi (I find this to be rather insulting to the Sith, but the development of such an organization is not unheard of).
Other precedents abound, as an indication of how one would develop a Force Tradition. For example, the Baran Do Mystics are the Kel Dor Force Tradition that focuses primarily on the Force as it pertains to Prescience. While they were mostly folded into the ranks of the Jedi, they exhibit mastery of their chosen facet of the Force precisely because they chose one particular facet of the Force. They also tended to direct their adherents towards a life of balance and peace so that they might better sense the delicate currents of the Force. This is, by definition provided earlier, a Light Side tradition. In fact, it's kinda difficult to pay attention to something so subtle when you're aching to put a lightsaber in another guy... or in Anakin's case another thing in a certain someone...
Other philosophies, for example the Zeison Sha, focus on a more overt power, Telekinesis. Again, because of their focus on a single facet of the Force, the phenomena that they manifest are often considered far more sophisticated than those that can be expected from the average Jedi. Further, this tradition is quite focused on protecting the family and surviving in a harsh environment. They may not eagerly go about seeking confrontation, but I could imagine that such a person would readily embrace the Dark Side from time to time if they had to or if circumstances demanded it (assuming that doing so actually provides a quick jolt of power, if not, then I would have to ask what the temptation of Darkness really is). This organization would, in fact, be a Gray order (though I don't much like that moniker) as they do not demand that every member be a meditative philosopher warrior, instead focusing on family and survival, both very natural things to select.
These examples are such that they show what a Force Tradition might become if it focuses on a particular application of the Force. The Zeison Sha are an example of both a focus and an environment to guide that focus. Their lives on a harsh world facilitated the devotion and ingenuity required to explore the Force. The Baran Do, on the other hand, suffer from a fatal flaw. As they are members of a peaceful society, there is no real reason for them to grow. If they do, it is merely an exercise in exploration for the sake of exploring. As the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. It doesn't need to just apply to technology, it works for anything; be it martial arts techniques or Force powers.
Ultimately, these examples form a baseline argument for the idea that there should be an array of Force Traditions, many unique to planet and species. Imagine, if you will, a Force Tradition that guides its members to behave like Mandalorians or Echani (I do believe the Imperial Knights fall into this category). Fighters to the core, some of their number may even be considered quite evil, but traditions and lessons taught are culturally-based. If we want a consistent measure of how the Force's Light and Dark Sides pertain to such a Tradition, it can't be based on subjective values. Hence the previous explanation of how the Force works. In many cases, you'll see that training almost automatically guides you towards the Light while dipping into the Dark as needed. There are precious few groups that teach their members to just go nuts, especially among social organizations. But, at the same time, there is a reason people say "Put your anger to constructive use" and such nonsense. That's dipping into the Dark Side (an extreme emotion) to do something good (which has no actual relevance to the Force). This should actually make it clear why most of your custom Traditions tend to be Jedi Lite.
So, already, one can see 8 traditions that might blossom strictly from the facets of the Force as I have presented them. If you want to think about which species might develop which tradition, you need only look at their culture. Bothans? Why, Clairvoyance with a touch of prescience and telepathy, of course. They focus on information and what better way to get that than with sensory abilities. Other species might explore other facets of the Force. In fact, I could see a Mandalorian cult that uses the Force to instantly kill or maim its enemies. Would this group be considered Dark? It's questionable, they might do so under the pretense of calm, purposeful concentration or they might fly into a rage and just snuff the life of whosoever catches their ire. The decision that you make as the creator of said Tradition (from a strictly metagame perspective) informs the nature of that organization and how it functions within the society in which it is formed and the galactic society that it would become a part of. I believe it was the Korunni (Mace Windu's planet and people) that embrace the Dark Side as an animalian and instinctual force that empowers the Force Sensitives (Shatterpoint).
Moving on, one would also have to consider the nature of the society and circumstances under which a Tradition might be formed. Many of them would be created in response to the beliefs of a charismatic founding figure who is also likely Force Sensitive. Her understanding guides her philosophy's adherents in what they view to be the Force and how they would develop their talents. The society colors this decision by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the foundation. For the Baran Do, the Kel Dor responsible for the publicity of this tradition may have averted some disaster through his perspective and development of the Force and subsequent Force Sensitives viewed that as the goal to which they should aspire in both method and result. Naturally, you don't have to decide all this in advance, but filling in these blanks, even after you decide where the Tradition would end up, helps to enrich the setting and the Tradition in question as well as inform how it might interact with other Traditions. Furthermore, you shouldn't be afraid to have redundant organizations. The fact of the matter is a good idea is a good idea regardless of who comes up with it. If the Duros had a tradition of Prescience and met with the Kel Dor who also have a tradition based on Prescience, then that doesn't mean that they need to be merged into one group. They may find ideas from each other that are novel, and then take what's good and go their separate ways from there. In fact, a prime example of society and circumstances dictating the creation of a Tradition is the Wardens of the Sky. These people, though extraordinarily few in number, use the Force for a specific goal and use whatever Force talents they may develop.
On the other hand, there has been galactic travel possible for over 4000 standard years. In a galaxy where cultures and peoples can travel with astounding freedom and exchange ideas and practices, a certain homogeneity can be expected. On the other hand, their differences might polarize the groups into rivalry. This, again, is the decision of the creator (meta-game) and that decision informs how the rest of the galaxy will likely react. Again, using examples from the setting, the Jedi and Zeison Sha have very different approaches to raising their adherents. Due to their history, the groups have certain feelings about one another, namely the Zeison Sha look at the Jedi as family destroying, child snatching, abandoners. Factually accurate? Perhaps. The implications may be a little worse than the facts, though. I don't know that the Jedi get to legally snatch any child that registers as Force Sensitive (no, I will not use the M-word) within the Republic, instead likely creating a social impetus for a family to want to allow the Jedi Order to adopt their children (a promise of a good upbringing and fulfilling one's potential in service to the greater good, for example).
Ultimately, the decision to have various Force Traditions is guided by what you think you need. I adhere to plausibility, and find that a tradition on each planet (possibly multiple traditions) is entirely appropriate. If the Force can be strengthened by bloodline, then embracing and breeding Force Sensitives can strengthen a culture, country, and planet. Even if the odds of having a Force Sensitive child are only 1 to 50,000, in a world as populous as Alderaan (say, 3 billion) there would be 60,000 Force Sensitives. If even 1% of them stopped to learn to use their power, perhaps sought out more like them, you would have a very rich Tradition forming, especially if you realize that there has been 4000+ years to develop this tradition. You can even add a few more zeros to the ratio and still have a large population of Force Sensitives. In a world and time where communication and travel is relatively accessible, you could develop quite a few varied Traditions. And that's not even taking into account the history of the Rakata Empire (or whatever it was that created the Star Forge from KotOR) and the time between then and "now."
Creating Force Traditions is a potluck process that can embrace any number of ideas, philosophies, and methods to create unique encounters true to the culture and species (as these tend to be unfortunately fairly synonymous) from which they develop. As Creator, even if you wanted to include a Force Tradition on each world that had a population large enough to support it, you would be swamped. Even within the Republic, not every person wants their child to join the Jedi and it would be tyrannical to force those parents to give up their children. And when those children grow up, the Jedi go about saying, "He's too old," and what do you think that young adult is going to do? Ignore his abilities in the face of the apparent power of the Jedi? Find more like himself and learn what he can? It varies, but I think enough might do the latter that you can have a Force Tradition that is like... the Jedi rejects... Youâ€™ll find yourself designing Traditions that stand out, you donâ€™t really need to get into details about every little cult that might emerge.
When crafting a Force Tradition, think about what their philosophy might be. Do they believe themselves to be classical good guys or the group that has to get their hands dirty for the greater good (few people embrace that theyâ€™re bad guys)? Do they even care about good? They might simply be seekers of knowledge looking into the vast reaches of the Force. What sort of things would their culture/species direct them towards and are they an example of this direction or are they a countercultural movement? Are they a religion, a secular philosophy, or even just a pack of metaphysical researchers? How do they feel about engaging in combat? What sort of mindset is the typical adherent expected to have when using her Force powers? How do they feel about the other Force Traditions? How complicated is their internal structure? Where do they live and how do they survive in that environment? How does the Force play into their survival? What do they want to be called? What do they want to be remembered for? Do they want to be known or would the adherents prefer secrecy?
Answering those above questions goes a long way towards crafting a new specific Force Tradition and ironing out what makes it unique or not. It is also important to go in with the idea that there are a great many Force Traditions out there and not all of them are going to get carefully defined. In fact, many may very well be part of a greater whole with similar beliefs and specific differences. The individual sects within a greater whole are already apparent in the Jedi what with their consulars and guardians and sentinels (oh my!) and doing so with other Force Traditions is not at all implausible. Whether these sects cooperate with one another or have a fierce rivalry is up to you, as the meta-game creator. In doing this, you give yourself fodder for creating a myriad of characters (and classes if you use d20) and have them have real interactions. In fact, once similarities are defined, the desire to make them unique can be fulfilled. Thatâ€™s an important thing; itâ€™s difficult to make something unique when you donâ€™t have a definition for what youâ€™re trying to separate yourself from.

Speaking of which, Rebaav and Xychotic, I owe you guys a read over and responses to your input. I'm limited in time, and since DarthAnthrax made (what seems, but we'll see) directly opposing views to what I was looking for, he captured my attention.
I'm gonna also that this time to point out just because I disagree with an idea, doesn't mean it's bad. We're just trying to figure out what should be in the Kaluim galaxy.

@ BreederofPuppets: No worries, have at. I'm pressed for time myself so I end up not being as eloquent as Xychotic, who seems to echo my observations very well.
The other contributions here have been good too just not as resonant with me... I really should have mentioned that before, sorry all.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-06-27 11:41:02)

Right, so I finally read up on a few things, including **Xychotic**'s input, Wookiepedia's articles on the the Potentium, The Unifying Force, as well as some about Jolee Bindo and Jacen Solo.
Going in order of appearance, not importance:
Xychotic said a lot of things I agree with. Tradiations that are focused in certain aspects of the Force, aren't limited by their choices. I like this. And s/he has useful insights that sit well with me.
The Potenium is not cool with me. It's seems to be made for anyone that wants all the cool Jedi powers and none of the restrictions. That'll be like playing a paladin without any moral, religious, or honor code. *But*...I can see it working. Not every active Force User will follow are particular tradition, or any tradition for that matter. I think we need to plan for that. It is a method of viewing/using the Force. I propose that it be a option for characters to take. Adjust the rules slightly, and allow characters to follow Potenium.
Unifying Force looks a lot like normal Jedi mindset, save a few descriptors. This is both nice (easy to understand) and yet bad (explains nothing).
Jolee Bindo looks like a player character some one put into a video game. A player character who was created by a sociology student. But he is interesting, and while I don't like his views (he is only accountable to himself, and no one else), I can't say it's completely wrong nor unusable in Kalium.
Well, my opinion of Jacen Solo got a bit worse, having read his whole history. His views and morals shifted as the his needs and wants changed. When he required the Jedi mindset, he used it. When he wanted to break people with the Force, he drifted toward the Dark Side. When he needed to be an over-powering archenemy of all living things, he became a Sith Lord. And I don't dig on the idea that torture is a way to teach some one about the metaphysical aspects of the universe. Ol' boy was, crazy, incredibly self centered and selfish, or straight up evil to the core. Or each one in turn. I'm not seeing his views overly useful.
I don't have enough time to comment further tonight. I'll see about adding more tomorrow. Thanks for the input.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-10-07 02:12:43)

This was pulled from another part of the Kalium Galaxy thread:
> **Avarna wrote:**
>

> what is the unique outlook on the Force that leads this tradition from the mainstream teachings of the Jedi?

Avarna is doing her job, of course, and since we are all familiar with the Lucas-verse and the Force within, using the Jedi as a base for everything else makes prefect sense.
This brings to question, however: what is mainstream in the Kalium Galaxy? Do we *have* a mainstream? Rowan imagined a galaxy where the Sith held popular sway, but not (exactly) the same Sith we all know and love/hate. Later, this process mutated to having several traditions, none of which were much more popular/powerful than the other. Personally, I am a proponent for having a handful of powerful traditions, and hundreds more of much smaller power level.
So what are we going with? Percentage wise, Jedi were at least 95% of the Force Users for the bulk of Lucas history, with only a few breaks. Even if the percentage was down to 50% (with all the other traditions splitting the other half), it would flavor the Force completely different in this galaxy.
What are yawl's thoughts?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-07 03:08:31)

I know I said somewhere before I should put together something about my views, but I never got around to doing it. Maybe I will later, if the need arises. But really, I don´t like writing science reports.
But still I think it would be interesting to have a Galaxy that has been able to look past the bonehead views of the Jedi, and realized that the Force isn´t Light or Dark, it´s Neutral. Of course, all traditions would differ slightly in their views, but the main idea would still be one of a neutral Force that don´t take sides, don´t have sides, and generally just exists as a tool. Like a wise man once said, "an energy field created by all living things". But that´s it. The Force is not your Galactic conscience, it is not a things that needs to be balanced, it is not an insidious thing that corrupts your mind and turns you evil. It is a tool, much like a blaster, and just like a blaster, using it is not inherently evil, but it is the nature of the act that can be either good or evil.

No need, I think. I just needed to re-read your previous posts, and, ya know, pay attention. At understand now: the Force is an unliving tool, an object or energy source, to be used by the wielder. I would go on, but you already did a very good job explaining it. Potenium is the closest example in "cannon" I find.
I take it this is what you want as mainstream. The default 'norm'.
I'm in favor of a good and evil sides Force, and have (our) Sith way of viewing things the 'norm'. What else we got?
Edit: typed up a bunch of crap talking about Potenium, and all that, but it had nothing to do with the conversation at hand. So...this is shorter now.

### **Avarna** (2009-10-07 11:27:26)

This goes back to the Stronghold idea I talked about in the submission forum.
The Jedi stronghold has always Courasant, But then there were the smaller academies and in they're role of guardians of the republic they traveled more then other traditions. thus making them the much more visible to the common people.
So the Kallium Jedi are no more numerous then the practitioners of other traditions. But we're going to be using them as the measuring stick of other traditions, simply because they are well known, and they're teachings avoid extremes.

Okay, but have nothing at all on their teachings, ways, or philosophies, so perhaps we should not be too quick to designate them the measuring stick.

I agree. Ithink you have the right way of doing the template. I meant to say that, but I guess it didn't translate from my head to keyboard
> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**

We need something to compare to, or we would have to start all over. So, we use the Lucas-verse Jedi as a comparison, even though the Lucas-verse Jedi won't be in Kalium. Because all of us know what the Lucas-verse Jedi *are*.

OK, now it makes a little more sense. But then I have to stick out the question, why? Why do we need to compare to the Lucasverse Jedi? What´s the advantage of saying "compared to the Lucas-verse Jedi, this tradition views the Force like this..." rather than "This tradition views the Force like this..."?
What I mean is that if I want to design a new Force tradition (and I´ve already begun), I´m not going to care about what other traditions thinks about the Force. This tradition has developed their own ways of using the Force, and as such also their own unique way of thinking about it, explaining it, and touching it.
For example, when someone designed the Fallanassi, I can bet you he didn´t think "Hmm, I wan´t some guys who doesn´t share the same view of the Force as most practitioners in the Galaxy...", but rather "Hmm, this could be an interesting wiev of the Force..."

What´s the advantage of saying &quot;compared to the Lucas-verse Jedi, this tradition views the Force like this&#8230;&quot; rather than &quot;This tradition views the Force like this&#8230;&quot;?

Best to think of it like you are describing a car, and bad boy car from the 70's. When you describe it to some one who knows what a car *is*, like some one not a cave man, you'll have it pretty easy. If you describe it to some one who knows muscle cars, he or she'll know very close to what you are talking about. And if you are describing a black 1967 Chevy Impala to Dean Winchester, he'll knows exactly what you are talking about.
So, we are all Star Wars nuts, so we know muscle cars; we have a frame of reference. When you tell us about your Force tradition Impala, we can say "oh, its like *that*, not this."
Yes, it's possible to start from the ground roots (and for complete, mind blowing new ideas, the better way to go), but we would have to, ya know, *start from the ground roots*. Having something to compare it to speeds everything up.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-08 03:42:28)

Yes, of course, but none of those things has anything at all to do with *designing* a new Force Tradition, but rather what people do naturally when trying to assess what something is, or when describing something.
What I´m saying is why do we need to set a specific tradition as the measuring stick for everyone else? Just let people use whatever they want to describe their traditions. If I design a tradition that has nothing whatsoever in common with the Jedi, why should I even begin to compare them to the Jedi, when I can find something much more suited.
We were already looking for a "mainstream" view of the Force to be the norm in the Galaxy, right? Then naturally this will be one of the first things you look to when you want to see what a tradition is like, do they differ from the norm?

---

### **Avarna** (2009-10-08 12:04:26)

And the Norm, is the Jedi.
I vision the Kallium Jedi to be much like the Lucus-verse Jedi. The only major difference is that they are a smaller part of the force using community and thus have a smaller area of responsibility.
End of the debate. I don't feel that your actually contributing to this discussion anymore and simply repeating yourself Thrax. Yes, The force tradition your working on has a radically different view of the force. Fine type it up. I'm not going to change the format I've selected, simple because you don't like the idea that the person REVIEWING force traditions needs something to compare them to to make sure they are balanced, with appropriate pros and cons for following that particular tradition. If this continues to be an issue, then feel free to not submit any force traditions.
I'm sorry, but this debate ending power is the reason we've selected to have managers for Kallium.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-08 12:29:21)

I´m not asking you to change anything about the format of submissions, where´d you get that from? Actually I just realized today that it is the same format used in the JATM, so I don´t have anything against that.
What I´m trying to get to grips with here is if we have a *tradition* or a *view* as the norm. Because if we are having a tradition as the norm, then it seems to me like that tradition has to be quite dominant, much like the Lucas-verse Jedi, and I thought we had decided on not having one particularly dominant tradition.
On the other hand, if we had a view as the norm, say we have the traditional Light/Dark side view as the norm, it would be a totally different situation.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-10-08 12:44:02)

Thrax, Why don't you go play with your technical stuff? I'm sure there are plenty of ships that need to be transferred into the Wiki.
I've **ENDED THE DEBATE**. I won't hear anything else on the topic. This is WHY we have managers now, to get things moving.
This doesn't mean that NEW questions can't be brought up. but I'm tired of beating a dead horse. ***I AS THE MANAGER AND PERSON REVIEWING FORCE TRADITIONS need something to compare things to make sure they are FAIR AND BALANCED.***

No need to snap, I was just expressing an opinion.

Which I don´t recall doing, and I don´t recall that being the reason we decided to assign someone to a certain area.
But don´t try to tell me what to do, ok?

### **master_Tru** (2009-10-09 07:35:18)

Ok this looks close to becoming out of hand. This is a game and is suppose to be for fun I do not see people having fun here .......
There are no right or wrong ideas an there are no wrong questions. As individuals everyone has an opinion and should not be harassed for it. The whole point of the forum base brain storm is to get multiple inputs in the creation of a setting that would feel familiar to everyone playing and running it. This setting could easily have been directed by one or a hand full of site mods but we felt it would be a great way to get everyone working together.
With that said place your ideas here please but **DO NOT** come down on anyone for their ideas or questions. AT the same time you must be open to criticism, this does not mean your vision must change only that another member may have an idea that could enhance your own. The idea of balance was brought up, that goes without saying ideas are not concrete until it has been approved.
So that was my friendly way of saying do not ruin this for the site, continue to share your ideas allow others to have theirs.
In the future if you have need to have a dispute settled PM myself I will intervene for the benefit of this community.

Honestly, master_Tru, Yes giving the community at large a say in the Kalium sounds like a wonderful idea. But look at where its gotten us, its a year since I started with GC and we are no closer to opening the setting. If people really want to make it a reality, then eventually someone is going to have to (As I've tried, in the small portion I have taken responsibility for) is finally cut off the talk and make the decision.

Actually, I believe that the reason the work is progressing so slowly is mainly due to the very periodical bursts of activity in this section. And also because of the limited input in decision makings. That said, I don´t think the right way to solve it is for someone to step in and say "OK, now I´m deciding that this is how we do it", but that might just be me. At least that´s not what I thought someone "managing" a section should be about.
What I would suggest to end the debate instead would be to set up a "deadline" poll, that remains open for a period of time, with the option to vote for the various suggestions that have arose. I feel like I can always happily draw back an idea if it is so that a majority of people want to have it some other way, but I don´t like it when other ideas gets discarded just because a single person has another idea that that person likes better. At least not when doing something supposed to be a group project.

Personally, I like the idea of polls, but the last one I put up got only six votes and I never closed it. And those six votes were hardly conclusive, though there was a majority.

Yeah, I remember that. A shame, but perhaps we should throw a new one, and then just go with the result. It seems like a decent middleway between having really large discussions and having a single person making the decision all alone.

I moved the last of the Force tradition threads from the Faction subforum to this one: The Ysanna and the Kel Dor Bendu. I don't think you need to read through them, Ava (except for the basics of the Bendu tradition) but they're here if we need them.
Also, I know SacredPhoenix and I were working on the Sith tradition before he disappeared. If anything got posted, it's not here anymore (or I can't find it). I'll see if I can find it on my hard drive and then I'll post it again.
