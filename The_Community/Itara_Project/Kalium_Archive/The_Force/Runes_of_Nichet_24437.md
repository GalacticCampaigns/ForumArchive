# Runes of Nichet

### **Avarna** (2009-10-15 18:07:18)

The Runes of Nichet are a a group of female force users, that have pledged themselves to the serves of the Royal Family of the planet Nichet. Their traditional weapon is the Nichet Crystal blade
**History:**
The origins of the Runes, started very humbly as the consorts of King Talar, the first ruler of Nichet, and it was continued by successors, female as well as male. Though the generations, the group slowly evolved from a simple harem into handmaids, unto they're final form of guardian companions.
While the Royal Family had always been strong in the force, its unclear when the first Force Sensitive joined the ranks of the Runes, despite the long oral history maintained by the tradition. It is known that several former Jedi have found a home among the Runes over the generations, bringing with them much of the Jedi's teachings. One important written document maintained by the Runes is the Roll of Fifty, the list of fifty Runes actively serving the Royal Family.
Today, all the serving Runes are Force Sensitive. Many of them able to trace they're bloodline back though several generations, and its not uncommon for a new member to take over the responsibilities of a mother or grandmother.
**Location:**
The Runes are most likely to be encountered on their homeworld of Nichet. However members not currently listed on the Roll of Fifty, are given the freedom to travel.
**Philosophy:**
The Runes don't distinguish between Light and Dark, accepting the Force as a single whole. They do teach that its only to be drawn upon in the fulfillment of their duties, and for the defense of themselves and other. Obvious displays of power are Forbidden, for many reasons, from the fear they might cause in others, to self reliance. They are also Forbidden from using the Force to directly injure another.
Marriage and childbearing is encouraged among the Runes, (and is one of the few ways to be removed from the Roll of Fifty with honor) not only to pass on their traditions but also to make sure the order remains strong with enough members to fulfill they're obligations. Many young Runes are raised within the Royal Household serving even at a young age as guardian playmates for the heirs to the throne.
A Rune's Crystal Blade is a symbol of their position as well as their weapon of choice. Its considered a grave insult to take someone's Blade (its a statement they are unworthy their position and duties) and its not uncommon for an Heirloom blade to be passed along members of a bloodline.
*Membership*: To become a member of the Runes, One has to be a Force Sensitive Female (Preferably human, but few species would be turned down), and swear an oath of fealty to the Royal House of Nichet.
**Rune of Nichet Talent Tree** 
Guardian's Leap: You may designate any ally within 12 squares of you when you activate the Harm's way Talent, and immediately move adjacent to them. If you do so, remove one use of the *Surge* force power. If you don't have a use of *Surge*, you may still activate Harm's Way normally.
*Prerequisites*: Harm's Way, *Surge*
Crystal Blade Mastery: You may spend a force point to Attune a Crystal Blade to you, receiving a +1 bonus to attack. This bonus applies to you and only you. Also, An Attuned Crystal Blade, is treated as a lightsaber for the purpose of the Block and Deflect Talents.
*Prerequisites*: Proficiency with Nichet Crystal Blade, Weapon Focus (Nichet Crystal Blade)
Vigilant Defender: If an opponent attempts to use the Tumble skill to move through your threatened area, increase the DC by your Base attack Bonus.
King's Guard: Trained to protect the Nichet monarch, you can more easily detect ambushes and traps. If you succeed in detecting an ambush or trap, you may spend a Force Point to add your Charisma bonus to the Reflex Defense of one ally with 6 squares of you. This bonus lasts until the start of your turn in the following round. This bonus is also cumulative, so that multiple characters with this talent may apply it to the same ally.
*Prerequisites:* Force Perception
Weapon Specialization (Crystal Blade): You gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls with your Crystal Blade
*Prerequisites*: Proficiency with Crystal Blade, Weapon Focus (Crystal Blade)

Two things about the talents.
**Vigilant Defender** - There is already a feat that accomplishes this (Tumble Defense, pg 35, KOTOR), except that you can´t use it while flat-footed. Which is kind of a moot point since you can´t make AoOs when flat-footed anyway. I´m not saying it can´t be a talent as well, but I personally consider feats "cheaper" and if I had to choose between spending a feat or talent for the same ability, I think the feat would be my choice.
Perhaps the talent could allow you to make one AoO even when flat-footed? Would combine nicely with the above mentioned feat.
**Force Cloak** - I´d like to know a little more about the reason for including this. They don´t strike me as the "hidden bodyguard" types, but maybe they´re meant to be, and I don´t see them using it for infiltration either.
Otherwise, looks nice.

I'll think about it.
Its not uncommon for a feat and a talent to have very similar effects so that doesn't bother me. (A perfect example is Force of Personality feat (GAW pg 23) and Idealist Talent (FU pg 25) Both allow you to use you cha bonus instead of your wis bonus for will def)
I'll think about replacing Force Cloak, if someone suggests or I come up with something more appropriate.

I like the history. Intriguing idea, methinks, and well put together. While acting as an honor guard and a harem is an old idea, making them mystics is new, especially in the Star Wars setting. Very nice.

The biggest issue I have is right here. It's a lot like taking the Jedi tradition and removing all the faults. They can use any power (cause nothing's inherently evil) in "fulfillment of their duties" (a bigger loop hole then 'self-defense'), they can marry, have little Force Users, go where they want, own what they want (they are backed by royalty), childhood friends with the prince and princesses), and so on. Other than a mild issue with carrying a unique blade around and family ties, there is nothing preventing this from being the prefect Force User group. Why not be these guys?
That's a reoccurring theme with me (power without price)) and maybe just me. You could be waiting on any Force rule changes, or more history, etc. They could be seeped in tradition and a myriad of ancient traditions, duty bound to royal decrees and missions all the time, unable to lie, or dozens of other things.
Basically, I'm wondering what, if any, is the down side of this organization/tradition?

I think you are seeing only one side of many of those things Breeder. They don´t view the Force in light and dark, yes, but is this only beneficial? Could there not be that they are considered as corrupted/arrogant/whatever adjective fits by many other people? Basically their philosophy seems to say "you can do whatever necessary in the fulfillment of your duty", this seems like it could certainly be viewed as arrogant and corrupt (the end justifies the means).
Also, you say "why not be these people?". The most basic reason why not is that they are limited to a single star system, meaning that you quite limit yourself in character background options if you want to be one of them.

### **Avarna** (2009-10-16 11:06:12)

I think Thrax covered most of it pretty well. Their area of authority is limited to a single system. Another thing that you didn't point out is that they're membership is more restricted then other traditions.
And I never said they could "own what they want" even though I didn't specifically mention that they couldn't.

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-16 13:09:52)

I'm with Breeder on this one. It's too easy for any player who wants to be a female Force user to be a Rune, because there are so few restrictions. They only have to be female--they accept other species, exiles from other Force traditions, people from outside the system. While their authority is limited to one system, anyone not on the Roll of Fifty can be found anywhere, so that would serve the needs of any beginning player anyway since they wouldn't likely be on the Roll.
The point where I disagree with Breeder is that while they aren't restricted by a fear of the dark side, that doesn't mean they can't get dark side points. But I don't see many other restrictions.
There is one thing you could do (but feel free to disregard it if you really hate it): you say they are discouraged from flashy uses of power--what if it was forbidden? No Force Lightning (in public anyway), no ripping Star Destroyers down with the Force, no Force storms, etc. They still have the powers, but they have to use them in more subtle ways. So what do you think?
And here's an idea for a talent to replace Force Cloak:
**King's Guard:** Trained to protect the Nichet monarch, you can more easily detect ambushes and traps. If you succeed in detecting an ambush or trap, you may spend a Force Point to add your Charisma bonus to the Reflex Defense of one ally with 6 squares of you. This bonus lasts until the start of your turn in the following round. This bonus is also cumulative, so that multiple characters with this talent may apply it to the same ally.
*Prerequisites:* Force Perception

I like it. Both the Talent, and the forbidding of use of flashy force powers, why not take it a step further and restrict them from using force powers that do direct damage? (so include telekinetic powers, as well)
I will edit to that effect.

First: I really like this group. I was concerned a bit about the Force being tied to, or effected by, bloodlines, and then their role as protectors of Royalty instead of being royalty. But I decided that bit ("We are born better, closer to the Force, than our rulers are. We are prefect, not they! We should rule!") for the stories and games. Seeds that can be grown later.
All in all, very cool.
Second: I am big on "Power with a Price". That's just me. It really isn't Star Wars, though. So, I am gonna try to back off with it. Might have to stay out of Force related topics.
But, other than that...very cool. Kudos, cookies, whatever, to you.
