<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Artisans</span>
*”The first fall of creation’s hammer resonates within all peoples and objects.
Resonance calls to Resonance; match your pitch to that of the world and all things become possible.”*
**Summary:**
A loose order who see the Force within things as resonances, the pitches of which can be matched or altered to great effect. They are consummate creators and tinkerers, unmatched at building and modifying thanks to their apparently mystical understanding of an object’s properties. The Artisan’s understanding extends to himself or herself and other sentient beings too, and they are capable of physical enhancements to their person and forceful control of others. Artisans typically excel at comprehending the physical, but are weak at using the Force to manipulate the mind. Most Artisans are at least moderately combat trained, the order having suffered violence in its history, and many wield a personally crafted [repulsor hammer](http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42937#p42937 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42937#p42937") that symbolises their connection to the order and its beliefs.
**History:** 
The historical documents of the Artisans are neither comprehensive or necessarily consistent, as the order is not particularly organised as a unit and few members have ever bothered with personal records. This makes it impossible to know for sure the origins of the order, though certain facts are known or can be extrapolated.
Firstly, the order came to be some centuries before the Sith War. Secondly, the order’s founder seems to be of a species not known in the Galaxy. Though there is no description of him on record and he seemingly never spoke of his origins, there are numerous references to his strangeness and uniqueness. It is possible that the founder’s homeworld and species has since been discovered, but rumours persist that it has not. Many Artisans suspect that there is a significant and rich heritage hidden somewhere among the stars, or even another order from which their own is derived.
At the onset of the Sith War the Artisan order was substantially larger and better organised than it has ever been since. There are more records from that time, and they are much more consistent, though the quality of such historical evidence deteriorates noticeably around halfway through the period. It is known that they suffered great losses for refusing the overtures of the Sith and aiding the Overlord’s enemies—a disastrous break from their political neutrality that the Artisans have never since repeated. One record, dismissed by most historians as preposterous, speaks of a Jedi attack on an Artisan stronghold following the order’s pulling out from the war effort. The Artisans themselves do not believe a member of their order would have invented such an extravagant lie, and are no more trusting of the Jedi than they are the Sith.
After the “fall” of the Order during the Sith War, the Artisans became more of a loose affiliation than an organisation. For centuries they remained divided and powerless, individual masters passing their knowledge to one or two apprentices and rarely passing into each other’s lives. The order barely survived in this fashion, and were seen as harmless yet handy to have around. Things began to change a century ago. Joi Bana, a human Artisan, took it upon herself to reunite the order. She travelled the Galaxy in search of others and established a headquarters on Bandor where they would be welcomed and able to have a say in the future of the order.
Even now, the Artisans are barely united as an order and are only loosely governed. Yet several times over the past century their voices have risen as one, and that unified voice is no longer so quiet as to be easily ignored.
L**ocation:**
The known headquarters of the Artisans is the industrial ice world Bandor, where the order derives a significant portion of new apprentices from the technologically apt youth of the planet.
**Philosophy:**
Did it all start with a word, a big bang, or a beat? The Artisans don’t claim to know exactly which, but they hold that at the moment of the Galaxy’s creation there was sound. For the first time it happened, and it was pure, and it both surrounded and permeated everything. Everything that ever was, is, or will be exists as an extension or evolution of that first sound—which they colourfully refer to as the “First hammer fall”—and therefore possesses a unique Resonance that is part of the greater score.
“Resonance” is the key to the Artisan’s beliefs, and is also the word they use to describe the Force. By understanding their own Resonance the Artisan becomes capable of impossible feats, and by understanding the Resonance of the people and objects around them the Artisan can change the world. It is this last part that the Artisans are truly concerned with—by comprehending Resonance they are able to better create or modify the products of their craft.
Artisans do not see the Force as inherently good or evil—to them after all Resonance is simply a fact of things, such as gravity or air. Personal feelings of individual Artisans obviously result in exceptions, but the order itself does not become involved with the philosophies and politics of Light and Dark. Resonance is a force to be respected and even revered, however, and is not seen as a simple tool. There is a great deal of ritual to any act of making by an Artisan, ideally including periods of meditation and reflection.
It often surprises students of the Force that members of this tradition apply it to tinkering with tech when their beliefs would surely incline them toward music? This is perfectly true, and the Artisans are often skilled musicians. Those Artisans whose music and Resonance are so synchronised they can use that music to enhance their abilities are known as Maestros, and are among the most respected of the order.
There is no formal requirement to join the Artisans except for the ability to see and manipulate Resonance. An Artisan who sees this quality in the personal Resonance of a prospective student may approach them with an offer of teachings. A person not approached in this manner who nevertheless wants to become an Artisan must first find the order and petition for a teacher—and an existing Artisan must be willing to take on an apprentice.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Artisan Talent Tree</span>
**Artisan:** When constructing or modifying any equipment or vehicle, your instinctive understanding of the object’s Resonance reduces the construction time by 25%. Additionally, the cost of the procedure is reduced by 10%. These reductions stack with any you receive from other sources.
**Maestro:** If you sing or play an instrument when you use a Force power that normally requires a swift action, move action, or standard action, you may use it as a full-round action instead. If you choose to do so, you may reroll your Use the Force check to activate that power, but you must accept the result of the reroll even if it is worse. If your instrument grants an equipment bonus, you may add it to your reroll.
**Repulsor Rush:** As a standard action you may activate the *surge* Force power and make a charge attack against a target. Your charge leading with a repulsor hammer generates a repulsor wave ahead of you providing you with with +2 to your Reflex and Fortitude defense until the start of your next turn.
*Prerequisites:* wielding a [repulsor hammer](http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42937#p42937 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&Itemid=2&jfile=viewtopic.php&p=42937#p42937"), *surge*
**True Artisan:** Your construction time reduction improves to 50% and the cost reduction improves to 20%. However, you may engage in a creation ritual involving meditation and reflection. If you do so, you may instead use the original reductions (25% and 10%) and grant a +1 equipment bonus to the object, or work with no reductions at all and grant a +2 equipment bonus.
*Prerequisites:* Artisan.
**War Beat:** You tune the Resonance of a weapon to make it particularly effective. You may spend a Force point to grant a weapon you are in the process of constructing (or your natural weapons, if you wish) either a reduction of 5 to its target's Damage Threshold, or a reduction of 5 to their Damage Reduction. You may alter the granted benefit at any time by spending another Force point and undergoing a period of meditation while dismantling and reconstructing your weapon (if applicable). The benefits of this talent stack with those granted by Devastating Attack and Penetrating Attack.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Discord</span>
*”If the Galaxy is a score it is our right as sentient and free-willed beings to rewrite it to suit our own musical taste.”*
**Summary:** A radical offshoot of the Artisans, the group who refer to themselves as the Discord believe strongly that it is foolish to revere Resonance and that it should be seen as both a resource to be exploited and a tool with which to work. This in itself wouldn’t be so bad, were it not for the fact that they also believe an understanding of Resonance entitles them to rewrite the score of the Galaxy as they see fit—right down to the last note if they so choose. Arrogant and militant, the Discord represent a hidden danger to the Galaxy that has so far gone undiscovered.
**History:**  The Discord were Artisans once. They still are, if one judges by teachings alone. Their radical beliefs and dangerous goals set them apart, however.
The foundation of the Discord occurred just over half a millennia ago, during the time in which the Artisans had fallen to their lowest. A Cadan Artisan called [insert Cadan name here] was unsatisfied with the order’s decline, and began to recent the pacifistic, politically neutral teachings of his mentor. Why couldn’t the Artisans be a force to be reckoned with in the Galaxy, when their understanding of the Resonance made them so strong? So he reasoned, and his resolution to bring change to the order grew. Even the knowledge that others who commanded skills like those of the Artisans existed and that they would no doubt resist any obvious action did not deter him—he would just have to be subtle.
As it turned out, the Discord did not become a power in the Galaxy during his lifetime, but his ideals lived on through the generations of disciples that have followed him. The Dischord has less than half the members of its parent order, but is significantly better organised and infinitely more driven. Worse, most members of the Discord are considered to be Artisans, leaving them perfectly placed for the inevitable coup. Discord members are also slowly infiltrating the Factions, though they tread carefully to avoid being discovered.
**Location:** The Discord have no official headquarters, though as long as their actions remain undetected and they are still considered Artisans, they are welcome in the headquarters on Bandor.
**Philosophy:** The Discord share a belief in Resonance with their parent order, but do not revere or even respect it. It is a means to an end, a simple fact of existence that happens to be an exploitable resource, no more important than electricity.
They also believe that their abilities mark them as special and are a sign of their right of ascendancy. Beyond taking over the Artisan order and changing its policies and philosophies, which is their immediate goal, the Discord desire nothing less than to create places of power for themselves in the Galaxy. Their preference would be at the top of the pile.
While an Artisan focuses on creation and does not use their knowledge of Resonance for destruction lightly, members of the Discord have no such qualms. If it benefits them to destroy an object or even a sentient being, they will do so without a thought or flicker of remorse.
For reasons of security, the Discord do not recruit unwisely. Only apprentices with no foreknowledge or preconceptions of the Artisan order are viable, and these are slowly tempered to share Discord philosophies before being properly inducted and allowed to share their master’s secret affiliation.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Discord Talent Tree</span>
Members of the Discord may select talents from the Artisan talent tree, with the exception of True Artisan, aspects of which require levels of patience they don’t possess. Instead, they have access to the following talent—
**Callous Craft:** Your construction time reduction improves to 50% and the cost reduction improves to 20%. Additionally, you may alter the Resonance of a piece of equipment you touch as a standard action. For the remainder of the encounter, the equipment possesses a +1 equipment bonus. However, such rapid modification puts stress on the object and thereafter it becomes imperfect, applying a -1 penalty to anyone using it until receiving repairs costing 1/10th its original value.
*Prerequisites:* Artisan.

I know I've brought this up with Simply in the chat, but I'm posting it here as well.
Force Craftsmen, or Force Bards, pick one.
The tradition just seems "off" to me. If they are artisans as you say, then why do they have a signature Weapon? Shouldn't it be a signature tool? And if that's so why a hammer, which is of limited use to create anything remotely sophisticated?
I'd very much like to here what other people think.

Me too. May as well get my responses out there for everyone's consideration.

Well first I should point out that I make it pretty clear that not all Artisans are both Force craftsmen and Force musicians (though many are Force craftsmen and non-Force musicians). The Maestros are quite rare.
And in the case of the Maestros, I don't see why "Force craftsman" and "Force musician" should be mutually exclusive concepts. Crafting and making music are both acts of creation, which is the definite overall shtick of the Artisans. Additionally, the most important aspect of this tradition is their belief that the Force is in fact Resonance - ie. vibration, or sound. Right or wrong vibrations can truly make or break the manufacture of an item (such as the proper use of a hammer when forging a sword) and can also cause destruction. So Resonance is an idea that lends itself to equally well to making, unmaking, and music.
I would also like to point out that traditions with multiple shticks are nothing new. We need look no further than the Jedi for that - they can be warriors, they can be monks, they can be philosophers, they can be politicians, and they can even be spies. Compared to that diversity, two different themes with a well-defined connection shouldn't be a big issue.

During the Sith War, the Artisans sided with the Factions against the Sith and became targets. They learned the hard way that they would sometimes need to defend themselves, and they developed a weapon that suited them and their beliefs.
> **Avarna wrote:**

The power hammer is symbolic - it *is* a tool (a small one could definitely function that way) or at least an icon of a tool, and the technologies within it also embody their belief in Resonance. And let's not forget that the Artisans poetically refer to the first sound of Creation as the "first hammer fall".

I'm gonna go with Scribe here on the symbolism deal. No, hammers aren't all that good for fixing modern equipment. But, why would a warrior society use laser swords (light sabers) at all, when blaster technology has been around for at least 25,000 years?
A hammer is a tool. An axe is a tool. A knife is a tool. All can and have been used as weapons. A spear and bows were hunting weapons.
A sword, however, has always been a man killer. That's it's only purpose. Warrior societies will use swords more than any other. Societies based on things other than putting sharp objects into other people will lean toward other items for their 'signature' device.
At least, that's how I see it.

I was portraying a Tiefling Smart Hero in a Urban Arcana game a few years ago. The idea was to mold him into an Artificer. The core concept was a modern take on a towns blacksmith ('cept he has horns) who plays with & fire & as well as the metal he works. Translate that to modern day, he eventually would have had a gauntlet PDA combo that he'd use to combine gestures to case/open spell files for casting.
Instead of demonic fire and brimstone energies in a forge this is ethereal Magi forging. I like it.
Oh, and my Tiefling did indeed have a hammer as his choice melee weapon... and a semi-auto gun that when modified to fully was said to have a hellfire trigger.
I totally get the thematic stuff and I think this is neat.

I like the Artisans, they're kinda cool. My one point of contention with it is the Weapon Specialization talent--just because they have a signature weapon doesn't mean they have to have a talent for it. They're not overly militaristic, so just the War Beat talent should be fine, I think.
The Discord, on the other hand, I'm not so sure about. Having an evil offshoot of a Force Tradition is just so *normal*-sounding to me. Doesn't every tradition have one now? What makes them different from all the other evil offshoots (other than their origin)?

I actually totally agree with this. But I had to have five talents for the template and couldn't think of a good fifth one. Any ideas?

I'm not particularly attached to the Discord myself. I came up with them as I was writing up the Artisans, and the idea seemed kind of cool so I wrote them up as well. But they don't have to exist if people decide they don't like 'em, since the Artisans define them rather than the other way around.

Getting into somewhat murky territory, but following on from my thought that your repulsor hammer is *less* practical than a lightsaber as a personal weapon.
How about adding a defensive talent for the repulsor hammers?
something that gives you temporary SR, Ref def or Fort def bonuses by messing with the repulsor generator? Or a tech crafting technique to add the setting to a repulsor generator?

These aren't bad ideas. Why not have a talent to give a bonus to a power hammer user's Ref Def? It could work sort of like Deflect or maybe Lightsaber Defense. It certainly fits better.
Or maybe an Artisan can detect a person's specific Resonance at a range, allowing them to identify specific people even when they can't see them. That's a pretty powerful ability, though, so it would need some prerequisites for sure.

### **Thraken** (2009-10-19 17:10:05)

actually my idea is none of those :P
I'm trying to make the things more useful as weapons, so not directly a force ability and I'm not sure you could use them like a jedi would directly block attacks with a lightsaber :P
Edit: How about
Artisan Interjection: As a standard action you may activate the *surge* force power and make a charge attack against a target. Your charge leading with a Repulsor Hammer generates a repulsor wave ahead of you providing you with with +2 to your Reflex and Fortitude defense until the start of your next turn.
Prerequisites: Repulsor Hammer, *surge*

### **Avarna** (2009-10-19 18:32:24)

Yes, being more defensive then offensive makes more sense to me.

That is neat. Consider it accepted as part of the talent tree. Gonna rename it "Repulsor Rush" though.
