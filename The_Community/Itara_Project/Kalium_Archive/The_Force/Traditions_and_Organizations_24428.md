# Traditions and Organizations?

### **Avarna** (2009-10-10 23:14:33)

MoDaVader pointed out to me, some of the Force Traditions that have been submitted before. Now apparently, it had been decided at one point to use the Organizations Rules from FU in association with Force Traditions.
This Poll is to determine if this is still desirable.

I think we should do both, at least for the larger Force traditions. The smaller ones, confined to one star system or so, don't really need it. But the bigger ones (like the Ysanna) can only benefit from the extra detail I think, though that will mean extra work.
I have to double check since it's been awhile, but I think the Ysanna had a non-Force sensitive branch, which is where having an organization template would be handy. Organizations, though, would be the exception rather than the rule.

I second this. Organizations is quite useful for larger traditions, especially if they have non-Force using branches.

Hmm... my force users are employed in the service of a government agency rather than followers of a religion/cult/secret society. They also don't have a unique talent tree. Would I need to put out a force tradition post or would just an Organisation post be fine?
Also I agree with both for the largest traditions. The Jedi had it's civilian staff that kept the place running.

I would say go for an organization.
