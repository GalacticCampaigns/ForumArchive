**<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">The Conclave of Twilight</span>**
Some Force organizations exists only to increase their own knowledge of the Force. Others seek to delve in the darker sides, granting themselves more and more power. And yet others serves a specific purpose. The Conclave of Twilight is all three. Created by a group of Force Sensitive agents, the Conclave soon expanded to become a Galaxy-spanning network of underground agents, having a finger in almost everything. The thing is, they makes a big deal of making sure no one knows. Working in secrecy, they have made themselves very influential, approaching, bargaining with, and even intimidating all forms of crime lords, officials, merchants, diplomats. And at the end, they uses the Force to subtly manipulate the minds of others, removing all traces of their prescense, but leaving the lingering memory of whatever they just discussed. Many are the crime lords who have found themselves performing a illegal transaction despite having a nagging feeling in the back of their head that they shouldnÂ´t, only to find their plans foiled utterly by unknown agents. To date, knowledge of their existence is very scarce, and whenever something seems to become more than just a fleeting rumor, their agents makes sure that the problem is taken care of. By any means necessary.
As a secret underground organization, the Conclave keeps their existance a secret, but in order to expand and survive, they have to recruit new members. They primarily recruits their members among Force Sensitives, but also others that have proven to possess the right skills required for the organization. Currently, their members are found among all layers of society, on both sides of the law, and in all species and organizations.
Working behind the scenes, the Conclave acts as puppet masters and controllers behind the scenes. However, there are many roles within the organization. Some members acts as information gatherers, others recruits new memmbers and â€influencesâ€ other parts of society. Yet others takes more direct action, performing tasks beneficial to the Conclave, no matter if they are legal or not.
While not directly dark, the Conclave operates on the border between light and dark, using any technique within the Force that suits their needs. They have develpoed powerful techniques for affecting the minds of others, and are especially adept at reducing their own prescense in anothers mind to insignificance.
**Type**: Force Tradition
**Enemies and Allies**: An organization that doesnÂ´t officiallt exists can hardly be said to have any allies. Or enemies for that part. Of course, there are forces in the Galaxy who values information above all others. Such organizations donÂ´t sit very well with the Conclave, and they are top priority for infiltrating. However, they are not beyond recruiting the help of other organizations when it can further their cause, but they of course do so incognito.
**Scale**: 17 (Partial Galactic)
**Organization Score Criteria**: In order to join the Conclave, the first you have to do is be sought out by a current member. You donÂ´t just contact then Conclave and wants to join in, then you are more likely to end up on their black list than anything else. Once you are approached though, what they requires of their members above all else is loyality. Members are not allowed to disclose any information about the Conclave whatsoever, not even about its existence, except to another member. How you determine who is a member is a carefully guarded secret.

Rank Score Title: Benefit
0 5 or lower None
1 6-10 *Informer*: The lowest-ranking members of the Conclave, informers are merely contacts stationed to gather information for the Conclave. Adept at gathering information for their wanting superiors, informers have learned to asses what is truly valuable. An informer gains a +2 bonus to Gather Information checks made to perform an Analysis.
2 11-18 *Agent*: Agents are somewhat seasoned members of the Conclave. They perform a lot of the practical work for the Conclave, spearheading infiltration and sabotage missions and other operations performed by the Conclave. Once per day, an agent can take 10 on any trained skill check, even if normally unable to do so.
3 19-25 *Ghost*: The ghosts are the field agents of the Conclave who handles the more subtle tasks. Bringing in new members, increasing the ConclaveÂ´s influence through blackmailing, intimidation and persuasion are all typical jobs for a ghost. When operating within the ConclaveÂ´s sphere of influence, a ghost always treats himself as one step higher on the tables describing situations and circumstances for Persuasion or Deception checks.
4 26-30 *Soldier*: Soldiers are among the highest respected members of the Conclave, and are responsible for keeping the ConclaveÂ´s will rooted among their followers. A character that cannot feel the Force cannot typically reach this rank without exceptional skills. The title of Soldier carries no special benefits with it.
5 31+ *Master*: The title of master is given only to those members who have acheived the highest levels of skill, and who have proven themselves to the Conclave over and again. No character without strength in the Force has ever been known to rise to this position. The masters of the conclave are secretive, and only the highest-ranking memebers knows their identities. From behind the scenes, they affects the Galaxy by having the ConclaveÂ´s will carried out. Due to the vast reaches of the Conclave, no wish is really out of reach for its masters, and he may requisition any equipment worth up to 10,000 credits withing 24 hours.
**Twilight Force Talents**
As master manipulators and puppet masters, the Conclave of Twilight have mastered many techniques that can alter the perceptions of others, and even influence their minds.
**Dampen Prescense** â€“ As by the Jedi Sentinel talent by the same name.
**Fleeting Memory** â€“ When using the Dampen Prescense talent, you may reroll your Use the Force check, and take the better result. Additionally, the opponent affected by this talent does not rememberexplicitly interacting with you, but he has vauge recollections of what you talked about. Any warnings, threats or orders you have given him remains in the back of his mind, he just cannot specify where they have come from. Prerequisites: Dampen Prescense
**Mental Probe** â€“ Using the Drain Knowledge talent does not automatically increase your Dark Side Score. Prerequisites: Drain Knowledge
**Intimidating Prescense** â€“ As a Full-Round action, you can make a Use the Force check and compare it against the Will Defense of all living creatures within 12 squares around you. If your check equals or exceeds the Will Defense of a creature, that creature will act as if you had successfully used the Persuasion skill to intimidate it, the first time you interacts with it.
**Reactive Mind** â€“ Whenever an effect that is using the Force to locate you (Farseeing, Sense Force, etc) makes a check and compares it to your Will Defense, you may spend a Force Point to immediately make a single use of that ability against the character attempting to sense you, even if you donÂ´t have the prerequisites.

not bad. I like it.

Not bad. It seems to overlap in some places with the Rom created by Frost and zerah. I'm curious as to how the two organizations would interact -- both being what they are, I'm sure they interact on some level.
There are only two mechanical things I see. All the organizations provided in the FUCG had only four ranks with mechanical benefits; you have five. Second, the benefits provided to the soldier seem to be too good, IMO. +1 Defenses against all enemies? I think it might be too much. I'd just let the soldier title be an honorific, and it solves both issues.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 17:18:52)

hmm, considering you listed your organization as not really having enemies, I'd have to agree.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 18:04:12)

Yeah, you are right.
What do you think of the Force talents?

Now, I'm not sure, since I don't have the book, but isn't there something like this in KotOr?

Now this one I like. I think it's really cool, and fits nicely with another talent I created some time ago. (See below.)

This one's cool, but aren't Force powers and talents usually restricted to a 6-square range?

This one is also cool. Nice job.
Now, reading your talents, I remembered one I had created for a game I GM. I think it would fit nicely in this talent tree, rather than the Force Adept's Dark Side Devotee tree, where I put it. The idea for it was to allow a Gray Force-user to use Force Lightning occasionally, without having to risk falling to the dark side too quickly.
**Straddle the Dark Side**
You are so adept at getting close to the dark side without using it that you can use dark powers with no ill side effects. Once per encounter, you may use a Force power with the dark side descriptor and not increase your Dark Side Score. However, there is a ten-percent chance that the Dark Side will still affect you. Roll 1d10, if a 1 shows up, you Dark Side Score still increases. If it does not, this talent works normally.
*Prerequisite:* One Force power with the dark side descriptor
