**Bendu Monk Talent Tree**
The Bendu monks practice a form of Teras Kasi, combining it with their force sensitivity, to make a highly accurate and highly damaging style of martial arts. Bendu monks also focus on visions of the future. Bendu Monks may take any of the following talents and may also take the Quickseeing force talent from the Luka Sene talent tree (see page 60 of KOTOR CG) and the Force Momentum force talent from the Keetael Talent Tree (see page 58 of KOTOR CG)
**Attuned Combat***: When fighting unarmed and unarmored, you may add your Charisma bonus to your unarmed attacks (instead of your Strength bonus).
*Prerequisites*: *Farseeing*.
**Empowered Fists***: You may use the Force to empower your unarmed strikes with the Force. Empowering your fists is a full-round action. For the duration of the encounter, you deal an additional die of damage with your unarmed attacks. The benefits of this talent may be reactivated at any time, though reactivation still requires concentration and a full-round action.
*Prerequisites*: Attuned Combat, Martial Arts I, *Battle Strike*.
**Shatterpoint**: Whenever a Bendu monk makes a Search Your Feelings Use the force check, they may spend a force point and instead choose to make a use the force check against a DC 25, and if they succeed, learn the long-term effects of an action, instead of the short-term effects of an action.
*Prerequisites*: *Farseeing*, Force Perception, Visions
**Crack the Surface**: Whenever a Bendu monk attacks an object, by spending a force point and making a DC 25 use the force check as a free action you automatically deal a critical hit (treat as if you rolled a 20 on the attack).
*Prerequisites*: *Battle Strike*, Force Perception
*Note these talents are from Saga-edition.com and are not my creation

The Bendu had originally been a passive force tradition. But after being attacked, they discovered the need to be capable in battle if the time ever came to fight. While the Bendu do not usually participate in the affairs of the galaxy, The Bendu have been known to subtly change things they see in their visions. The Bendu's only real enemies are the Jensaarai, who they feel are too reckless in changing the galaxy, and create more problems then they solve.
Type Force Tradition
Enemies and Allies The Bendu have no real allies. The Bendu are neutral to most other force traditions, but are enemies of the Jensaarai.
Scale 15 (galactic region)
Organization Score Criteria Only force sensitiveâ€™s are allowed in the Bendu, and joining them involves going to one of their monasteries and being tested for enough force sensitivity. Those who join the Bendu monks undergo intensive martial arts training, and as well learn the subtleties of farseeing.

Reviled -1/4 Dark Side Score
Rank Score Titles: Benefits and Duties:
0 3 or lower None
1 4-12 Initiate: The new joiners of the Bendu Monks are usually initiates. Initiates are still going through training. Once per encounter, an initiate of the Bendu may deal +1 die of damage on a single unarmed attack. The use of this ability is declared after the initiate makes his/her attack roll, but before damage has been rolled.
2 13-22 Monk: Those who reach the monk status are full members of the Bendu, and handle the basic training of Initiates. A monk may reroll any check made to Search your feelings, or use farseeing, and may take the better result.
3 21-30 Battle Priest: Battle Priests have long trained in the Bendu ways, and have much skill in unarmed combat and farseeing. Battle Priests as well are the ones who fight the Jensaarai enemies, though such combat is rare. Battle Priests get a +2 organization bonus on attack rolls and skill checks made against the Jensaarai.
4 31 and higher Grand Master Monk: Very few monks ever reach this esteemed rank. Becoming a Grand Master Monk means you represent everything the Bendu stand for and have distinguished yourself in the Bendu. Grand Master Monks may use farseeing, empowered fists, and search your feelings, as a move action instead of a full-round action, and may share your visions with other force sensitiveâ€™s (which operates exactly like the memory sharing ability of the caamasi, except you can only share visions, and those receiving the vision must succeed on a DC 15 use the force check).

Bendu Sage monks focus on seeing the future, and figuring out the will of the force. They do train their fighting skills, but do not focus on them as the Warrior monks do. Sage monks also use more force powers, though generally only defensive ones.

Cool! I like them. There are only two things I can see. One, Attuned Combat should read, "add your Charisma bonus to your ***unarmed*** attacks," (emphasis added). This is more of a clarification issue than anything else.
Two, I think the benefit for Initiates is too powerful. Combine that with Empowered Fists, Teras Kasi Basics, and Martial Arts I and II, a fifth level Bendu Monk with a Strength of 10 could do 4d8+2 damage -- more than a blaster rifle.
I think that might be too much for that level, even at once an encounter. Switch the bonus with the Monk's, maybe, and it could work. It's mostly just a balance issue.

hmm, alright. I'll edit it now
wait a minute, at 5th level you can't get teras kasi basics :P
besides, the black sun operatives get the same exact benefit, but it works with any weapon (and it's at the same level initiates are at)

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 17:45:15)

Why not? It's only prerequisite is Martial Arts I.
Oh, never mind. I'm looking at it right now, and it requires the Elite Trooper prestige class. In that case, it'd only do 3d8+2, the same as a blaster rifle, and only once per encounter. That wouldn't be overpowered then, if you left it.

well, I added two examples of bendu monks in the 2nd post
