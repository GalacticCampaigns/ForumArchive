Narrans live in the oceans of their homeworld, Jevim Nar.  They were willing to share their world with the people who destroyed the land, showing them how to live in harmony with their environment. 
The colonists, though, refused to share their technology, and so the Narrans remained primitive.  They are happy to live that way, believing it keeps them in tune with their world.  They try to live harmoniously with nature, and have constructed entire cities within their worldâ€™s widespread coral reefs.
For transportation, the Narrans have domesticated a local shark species which can dart through the water at speeds over sixty kilometers per hour.  There are dozens of other aquatic species that they have domesticated, to fulfill every need their society has.
**Physical Description:** Narrans are humanoids with bluish-gray and white scales covering their stout bodies.  Their hands and feet are webbed, allowing them to move easily through their watery home.  They have three head tails: two smaller ones in front, and a thicker and longer one which falls down the back and ends in a small, colorful fin.  Two brightly colored fins extend outward from their elbows, and can move independently thanks to the muscles lining the tissue.
**Personality:** The colonists of Jevim Nar know the Narrans for their gruff manner and sheer stubbornness.  It is often said on Jevim Nar that, â€œIt would be easier to get a Sith to run a nonprofit charity than to make a Narran change his mind.â€  Still, they are unusually generous to strangers and welcoming to outsiders.
**Homeworld:** Jevim Nar
**Language:**  To outsiders, the Narran language often seems like mindless guttural sounds, though in reality it is an extraordinarily complex language.
**Example Names:** Narran names are all but impossible for most species to pronounce, so they are often given nicknames by those they interact with.
**Adventurers:** Narrans are not too concerned with the galaxy beyond their home.  Still, some young Narrans make it off world on one of the colonistâ€™s ships.  These Narrans are generally scouts or scoundrels.  Force-using Narrans are surprisingly common, though they are generally weaker in power.
**<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">Narran Species Traits </span>**
All Narrans have the following species traits:
**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma.  Narrans are a hardy and extremely bright species, a bit gruff and stubborn.
**Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Narrans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** 6 squares, swim 4 squares
**Breath Underwater:** As amphibious creatures, Narrans canâ€™t drown in water.
**Expert Swimmer:** A Narran may choose to reroll any Swim check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse.  In addition, Narrans may take 10 on any Swim check, even when distracted or threatened.
**Low-light Vision:** Narrans ignore concealment (but not total concealment) from darkness.
**Grasp of Language:** Narrans have a very complex mind, which allows them to grasp languages with extraordinary ease.  Anytime they encounter a new language, a Narran can make a DC 10 Intelligence check to see if they can understand it.  This works for written, spoken, and nonverbal languages.
**Primitive:** Narrans get only Weapon Proficiency (simple weapons).  Only soldiers get more, and itâ€™s WP (pistols)
**Automatic Languages:** Basic and Narranese

Hate the primitive trait.  But that has nothing to do with your species.
Very cool.  I like this one, too.
Issues: stubborn species without a bonus to Wisdom or Will Defense?  I'd take the intelligence out and beef up the one of the two.
Good job other wise

That's actually a good point.Â  They should get a Wisdom bonus.Â  They are still primitive, even with occasional access to technology, so maybe they're not too bright, either.  I'll give them the Wisdom bonus.
