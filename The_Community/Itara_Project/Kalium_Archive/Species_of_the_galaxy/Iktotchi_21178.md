Iktotchi
**Ability Modifiers**: +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma, -2 dexterity. Iktotchi are wise, but not sociable, and have little manual dexterity.
**Medium Size**
**Speed**: 6 squares
**Natural Telepath**: An Iktotchi gains a +5 species bonus using the Telepathy aspect of the Use the Force Skill and can make untrained Use the Force checks to use this application even without the Force Sensitivity feat.
**Bonus Feat**: Iktotchi gain the Telepathic Training feat as a bonus feat.
**Precognition**: An Iktotchi that can use the farseeing power, and may make checks to activate the Sense Surroundings aspect of the Use the Force Skill, may reroll Use the force checks to activate the farseeing power, and to use the Sense Surroundings aspect of the Use the Force Skill, but must take the result, even if it is worse.
**Automatic Languages**: Basic and Iktotchi
The Iktotchi are a well renowned species, having long been a part of galactic society. The Iktotchi have been born with natural telepathic abilities, and all Iktotchi learn to use them to a certain extent. While not all Iktotchi are force sensitive, those that are find their telepathic abilities are exponentially strengthened. The Iktotchi government is comprised of force sensitives, who also run the Psylan, a force tradition made up of telepathic species. The Iktotchi use few blasters or melee weapons, choosing to use their minds as their main weapon, though they often carry swords and blasters just in case they meet someone particularly strong willed. Personality: Iktotchi have difficulty interacting with other species because they mask their emotions. A little known ability of the Iktotchi was their precognitive abilities, as they could predict the future, and had the ability to sense their opponents positions more clearly because of it.
Physical Description: Humanoid, with two horns curved around the sides of their heads. It gave them an unfriendly appearance, not usually helped by their stoic appearance.
Homeworld: The homeworld of the Iktotchi is the planet Itoka.
**Telepathic Training**
**prerequisite**: Force Sensitivity feat, or the Natural Telepath racial quality.
**Benefit**: As a standard action, you may make an untrained (even without the force sensitivity feat) use of the Use the Force skill, and make a use the force check against a target within 12 squares and line of sight. If the result equals or exceeds the targets, will defense, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, also adding their Charisma modifier and half heroic level to the damage. This damage ignores SR and DR. This is a mind-effecting ability (and so can only be used on living creatures).

Nice. I like it.

I donÂ´t like the feat.
It seems to offer very little, at least in my opinion. The only time IÂ´d really use this over a real weapon would be if I am bound and incapacitated, or otherwise unable to hold a blaster, or possibly from stealth. And then it does to little damage to be really useful IMO, since if it donÂ´t kill them outright, theyÂ´ll most likely just knock you unconscious.
At the very least, I think it should warrant a Dark Side Score increase.

If he adds into it the fact that anyone with the feat has access to the Telepathic Talent Tree, does that help?

Yeah, IÂ´ve noticed that it does give acess to a new talent tree, and that helps it a little. But still, to me, that would make this a feat that you take just to get the talent tree, and be without value in itself. Since I donÂ´t care much for "useless" feats, I would rather see it having some other effects totally.

Originally, it did give you the ability to make UtF checks untrained to activate Mind Trick, and gave a number of uses of Mind Trick equal to 1+Wis mod). I thought it was too powerful with that, and so he made that part an extra talent instead.

How about if it gives the ability to make untrained check to use Telepathy, and activate Mind Trick and Fear once per encounter?
That way the talents that gave Mind Trick and Fear a number of times, could instead allow you to use these powers multiple times per encounter, or another effect completely.
I also thought of a way that those talents could be exploited. If combined with the Force Exertion talent, you could take all the uses you donÂ´t use, and trade for another power.

force exertion isn't very easy to break, first it gives you a persistent condition, also, you can only use it with powers you already have, so pretty much unless if you don't have other force powers you can only gain mind trick or fear.
