**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Personality Description</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The barabel are ruled by instinct, tempered by strong morals. Carnivores, they are predators first and foremost, with a strong and well advertised aggressive disposition. In the company of other species, even a demure and reclusive barabel may easily be seen as a forceful personality. Their hunter instincts serve them well in physical pursuits- they are known as excellent and relentless hunters- as well as that of business, where patience and ruthlessness are highly prized assets.
Barabels are also pack creatures by nature, and work exceedingly well in groups with a well defined leader. From hunting for food to stalking the next finical acquisition, barabel work flawlessly within their family and packs (occasionally these â€˜packsâ€™ include other species), focusing on the bringing the â€˜preyâ€™ down. However, they naturally expect a share equal to their efforts, and can be cruel if they feel they did not receive their fair share.
In barabel society, leadership is clearly defined, and not easily questioned. Though physical strength is important, barabel understand the importance of a quick mind and strong voice in their leaders. If a leader grows weak or otherwise unsuitable, a new one must take their place, least the pack or family suffer. Barabels are naturally inclined to take this role, even if they know they are unsuited, if a better qualified individual fail to do so. Strong leadership is required.
Notorious for having a hard time expressing themselves to non-barabels, these reptilian creatures convey both amusement and grief by â€œsissingâ€. Other emotions, outside of anger, are detected only by scent and body language. Few species find hard to sense when a barabel is angry or hungry, however.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Physical Description</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Barabel average between 1.9 - 2.2 meters tall, with thick dark scales, usually ranging from dark red to a deep green to black. Their necks are thick and short, and deeply set, yellow eyes, a flat, wide nose, and board mouths filled with sharp, flesh tearing teeth adorn their scaly heads. Barabels are cold blooded creatures, with long tails and sharp claws on both their feet and hands.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">History</span>**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

When the galaxy was first made aware of the barabels, they were a primitive, if brutal species. The less morally restricted types quickly grew to appreciate the reptilianâ€™s strength and skill at hunting, and often made slave runs to collect prize fighters or entertainingâ€¦prey, for exotic hunters.
The barabels, largely not understanding the motives or goals of those who raided them from the sky, were more interested in a series of inter nest wars that consumed their species. Even defense against the raiders and slavery took second place to the world wide conflicts. It wasnâ€™t until the Jedi stepped did the infighting stop.
The Jedi, concerned about a species so locked into battle and bloodshed they would allow their family be stolen from them, selected their most skill diplomat to mediate the barabelâ€™s massive wars, and to bring an end to the bloody conflicts. Unfortunately, the diplomat was assassinated by an unknown (suspected Sith) intruder the night before the dispute was to be resolved. The Jediâ€™s apprentice attempted to finish what his master started, but failed, miserably. This set off a series of even that eventually lead to Barabel I becoming the victim of planet wide nuclear bombardment.
The Sith stepped in a short time later, attempting to help the irradiated planet and its resilient population. The Sith diplomats were not heard from again, and were presumably eaten.
Other groups approached the barabels, offering assitence, but were much more careful, and keep a greater distance during their efforts. Eventually, most of Barabel was made hospitable again, and the reptilians joined the Kalium galaxy as equals.

</details>

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Languages</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Barabel. The language includes mainly barks and hisses which are all harsh-sounding.
Most barabels are literate in their native tongue- whose letters are literally scratched into surfaces with their claws- but are not prone to learn other languages, unless it is deemed necessary.

</details>

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Example Names</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Barabel names are generally short, brutal affairs. Their family names grow over the ages, with heroes or villains of their family adding their title to the end. It is not uncommon for a barabel, when bested by a vastly superior barabel, to ask for acceptance into the victorious nest, taking that last name of the victor if accepted.
**Male:** Ragath, Vangar
**Female:**Tesar, Saba

Another species slightly alterred, hopefully to fit into Kalium galaxy. And no, **Rebaav**, I didn't just decide to do Barbel. Hopefully all of this will help the Barabels find a home in Kalium.

my 2 creds is +4 to str, +2 to con, and penalties to cha, wis, and dex, like the wookies.
or, if we want the "they evolved slightly different in the kalium galaxy" could change around the physical bonuses/penalties.
rage is an obvious species trait, I doubt anything short of full mutations would change their anger issues.
another to consider are natural weapons, but maybe we can change them, saying they've evolved or adapted, and so have different natural weapons.
primitive is another thing to consider, but, maybe in the kalium galaxy they have been more technology integrated.
and intimidation, just like the wookies :
also, maybe great fortitude (like twileks), a +2 fort bonus.

> primitive is another thing to consider, but, maybe in the kalium galaxy they have been more technology integrated.

I really don't like the primitive trait. Most primitive species are combat types, and the trait cripples non-Jedi combat types. Plus, it makes no sense to assign toa species that has been part of the galactic society for years.
Everything else looked good, though. I don't want a copy of the wookies, but these guys are suppose to be strong and tough, right?
> also, maybe great fortitude (like twileks), a +2 fort bonus.

This I really like. Maybe I'll switch it out with with a base trait, onc I get a hold of my books.
Thanks fer yer input.

yah, I don't like having a wookie copy either, but their traits match the wookies incredibly closely.
Another thing to consider is giving them scent, but I think that a penalty, or a bonus would need to be given/taken to balance it.

Heym there was a d20 to Saga converstion somewhere for UAA. The link I had is no longer around. Anyone know where it's at? Os a site simular?

Nevermind. I discovered I copied the whole document and put it on MS Word. Go me!
Here are the stats suggested from that source:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom.
**Medium-size:** As Medium creatures, the Abyssin have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** Barabel base speed is 6 squares.
**Natural Armor:** Barabel have a scaly hide that provides a +2 natural armor bonus to their Reflex Defense. A natural armor bonus stacks with an armor bonus.
**Natural Weapons:** A Barabel cab choose to attack with a claw, a bite, or a tail slap instead of making a normal unarmed strike. Each of its natural weapons deals 1d6 points of damage plus the Barabelâ€™s Strength modifier, although they type of damage varies as follows: claw (slashing), bite (piercing), tail slap (bludgeoning). These attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
**Radiation Resistance:** Barabel receive a +2 species bonus to Fortitude Defense against radiation.
**Darkvision:** Barabel ignore concealment (including total concealment) from darkness. However, they cannot perceive color in total darkness.
**Primitive:** Barabel do not gain Weapon Proficiency (pistols, rifles, of heavy weapons) as starting feats, even if their class normally grants them.
**Intimidating:** Barabel may reroll any Persuasion check made to intimidate others, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse.
**Automatic Languages:** Barabel.

</details>

I hate primitive. That being said, this looks pretty solid. Sure, they got -2 total attribute bonus, but they have lots of extras (Darkvision not being as common as it used to). Natural weapons are nice, especially if martial arts increase the damage they deal. What do yawl think?

martial arts does not increase the damage of natural weapons. Hmm, I think it's ok overall, though I think it'd be cool to change it around a little bit.

Buh?
I like the build, seems to follow what was presented in D6 anyway.
Any thoughts to other Races? Actually more thoughts related to Kallium itself would probably help with any of these "mutations" or "alterations" that have been mentioned. *How* and *Why* does Kallium change the races? I'm going to post that in Brainstorming.

my view is that there can be any number of factors. Maybe their environment in Kalium is different than Lucas'. Any number of diasters could have occured, causing them to adapt to their new surroundings. stuff like that.

Honestly, I had a reason for saying that. I think I thought I was being funny. Now, I have no idea why I wrote that.
Anyway, I cleaned it up, again, and thinking about their stats.
