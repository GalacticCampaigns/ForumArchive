<span style="font-size: 1.40em;">**Nautolan**</span>
The Nautolans are an amphibious race, and are more at home in the water than anywhere else.  Their head tendrils give them their sense of smell (not their noses) and they barely function out of the water.  The tendrils also serve as a pheromone sensor, and their pheromones serve as a major part of their language, which is why they rarely speak it outside of the water.  To other races, the constant pheromones emitted by the Nautolans give them the smell of chlorinated water.
A major part of Nautolan physiology is their adrenaline.  While, for most species, adrenaline suppresses the immune system, it does the exact opposite to the Nautolans.  Their immune systems are dependent on a flow of adrenaline through their blood stream, and failure to pump adrenaline through their systems can have some severe side effects, including death.
They are generally a peaceful species, though they enjoy combat as a sport.  While duels and gladiator combats are common, rarely do they engage in fights outside of those organized sports.  While a good number of them become soldiers and mercenaries, more of them lead peaceful (if always exciting) lives.
**Personality:** The Nautolans have an almost insatiable thirst for adventure.  They live for the thrill, quite literally, as a matter of fact.  Since they have to seek out action and get their blood pumping or suffer immune system problems, they have a very action-oriented culture.  They are a race of thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies.
**Physical Description:** Nautolans are green or blue-skinned amphibians, with large, black eyes.  They are humanoid in appearance, though they have tendrils sprouting from their head in place of hair, and are generally taller then the galactic norm, if only slightly.
**Homeworld:** The misty, bog-filled, wet world of Sender, in the Outer Rim
**Language:** Nautolans speak Nautila, but the language is pronounceable only while underwater.  Above the surface, Nautolans speak Basic, a language they have little trouble with as it is much simpler than Nautila.
**Example Names:** Kit Fisto, Ploss Niklos, Setel Yast
**Adventurers:**  Their adventurous nature creates the opportunity for heroes of all stripes to emerge.  The Force is somewhat weak in the species.  Though they have the same number of force sensitives as other races, they are not as powerful.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Nautolan Species Traits** </span>
Nautolans share the following species traits:
**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Constitution, -2 Wis
**Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Nautolans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:**  Nautolan base speed is 6 squares
**Adrenaline Junkie:** Nautolans live for thrills.  For every day they do not make an Initiative check or engage in an extreme activity such as sky-diving, make an attack (+15 +2 for every previous check since) against their Fortitude Defense.  If the attack succeeds, the Nautolan moves one persistent step down the condition track, which may only be reversed after the Nautolan engages in such an activity.  When he reaches the bottom of the condition track, he falls into a coma, and loses 1 point of Constitution every day.  When his Constitution reaches 0, he dies.  Alternatively, instead of engaging in extreme activities, a Nautolan may receive a shot of their adrenaline, which has the same effect.  Each shot may be applied with a DC 10 Treat Injury check, and costs 10 credits.
**Adventurous:** Nautolans are always ready for anything.  They may reroll any Initiative check, but the must keep the second result, even if it is worse.  Their reactions, though, are much faster in the water, where they may accept the better result of the two Initiative checks while in it.
**Breathe Underwater:** As amphibious creatures, Nautolans canâ€™t drown in water.
**Damage Reduction:** Nautolans gain DR 2 due to their thick, rubbery hides.
**Expert Swimmer:** A Nautolan may choose to reroll any Swim check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.  In addition, Nautolans may choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even when distracted or threatened.
**Fog Vision:** Nautolans ignore concealment (but not total concealment) from any source.
**Automatic Languages:** Nautila and Basic

It's a little later than I was going to post it, but it's up. 
Finally.

Nautolans are in the Clone Wars Campaign Guide. (Not to mention on a RPGA rewards card) with much different Racial traits. Just thought I'd mention that.

Hmm, well, I don't have that book yet, but I modified that stats from the Battle of Glee Anselm card.

Well since it's already posted I'll my opinions. I think that the adrenaline junkie needs a little work because I don't think it works with you describing them as peaceful. And maybe turning the pheromones they emit into some sort of natural weapon

I do describe them as adrenaline junkies more than I do peaceful, but you're right, maybe they should be an aggressive race.  I'll have to think about that.  How do you think the Adrenaline Junkie ability works, though?  I thought it might be needlessly complex, but I couldn't think of a way to simplify it.
As for getting a pheromone natural weapon sounds really cool, though I don't know if it'd work in practice.  It'd have to be a poison, and work over an area, and that might be too unbalancing to give a race.
Thanks for the comments. (And, really, if you want, I can always make them Mon Calamari.  I just picked Nautolan because it was there.)

well i think it is overly complex, but an interesting idea. it just needs to be simplified and balanced a bit. i'll see what i can come up with.

yes a more aggressive would be good. maybe even have a special type of sword that each one gets as proof that they are now an adult

Knife. Or broaden it to blade, with the blade length dependent on the involved parties respective wealth. The poor can afford only a knife, while well to do merchants have long swords or even vibro blades with jewels in the hilt.
