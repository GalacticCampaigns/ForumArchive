# Six potential species?

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-18 16:29:14)

Similarly to the Abo'eth I posted in the Force forum, these species were developed for my Wartorn Galaxy. Again, I don't see any harm in using them for Kalium too if people like them.
I've just copied these directly so their profiles might not/probably don't fit with Kalium as yet. I'll wait to see if the panel think it's worth adapting them before doing so.
[[Oh, and a shameless promotion: for a chance to play any of these species, check out my casting call in the General section. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->]]
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Bedhri</span>
The Bedhri (singular “Bedhu”) are a devil-like species native to the Outer Rim world of Bedhana. Primitive by the standards of the larger galaxy, Bedhri have a tribal society and a pragmatist’s view of killing that makes them valued in roles such as criminal enforcement. Many have been drawn off –planet by the promise of wealth and the lure of advanced technologies, though the species as a whole remains resistant to attempts to bring their culture to an acceptable level of civilisation for inclusion into galactic society.
**Personality—**Bedhri are easily pleased but also easily angered, and are quick to act on either emotion. Because their behavioural code differs from the one understood by most of the rest of the galaxy, misunderstandings are frequent and they usually lack the self-control to work out their differences rather than engaging in conflict. Still, a Bedhri befriends a person, they will literally die for them and are truly loyal allies. The trick is in managing to maintain such a friendship.
**Physical Description—**Averaging 1.85 metres in height when upright, the red-skinned Bedhri look like nothing so much as devils, with yellow eyes, horns, and whip-like tails. Their hands have only three fingers and a thumb, and their long feet have only three toes—all of which are tipped with sharp claws. A Bedhri’s hair, usually worn long, is usually white or a very pale red.
Bedhri are attractive in a dangerous, predatory way, and they naturally exude pheromones that make the weak-willed infatuated with them.
A Bedhri reaches physical maturity at age 16. If they live to old age, Bedhri can reach 400 or more. However, the majority die long before old age catches up with them.
**Homeworld—**Bedhana, an Outer Rim world. Mountainous and rugged,Bedhana is a hot, arid planet.
**Example Names—**Azarak, Ajja, Bikka, Bivak, Izarak, Kaja, Kovak, Kozak, Odda, Ojja, Ovva, Qikka, Xivak, Zaja, Zozak.
**Adventurers—**Bedhri that travel off-world quickly find that the easiest way for them to carve a niche is through violence, which suits them fine. The rare few Bedhri who have the patience to learn can become cunning manipulators with the stereotype of their species helping to hide their intellectual prowess.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Bedhri Species Traits</span>
**Ability Modifiers—**+2 Strength, +2 Charisma, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom
**Medium Size—**as Medium creatures, Bedhri have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed—**Bedhri base speed is 6 squares.
**Primitive—**Bedhri do not gain Weapon Proficiency [Pistols, Rifles, or Heavy Weapons] as starting feats at 1st level, even if their class normally grants them.
**Pheremones—**when using Persuasion to change an attitude, a Bedhri reduces the penalty to his or her roll by one step.
**Natural Weapons—**When making an unarmed attack, a Bedhri may choose to use its claws. They are considered armed when using natural weapons, and deal 1d6 damage with their attack.
**Low-light Vision—**Bedhri ignore concealment (but not total concealment) from darkness.
Conditional bonus feat—a Bedhri with Endurance as a trained skill gains Skill Focus [Endurance] as a bonus feat.
**Automatic Languages—**Bedhri (speak only).
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Greege</span>
The Greege (singular “Greeg”) are a race of four-armed humanoids from the Zanten Space planet Greegen. They are a curious species, always interested in what is around the next corner, and many have travelled off-world to explore the possibilities of a wider galaxy.
The Greege culture values both cunning and knowledge, and even the most mundane Greeg has some small talent for spying. Most do so out of habit more than maliciousness, as great respect can be gained on Greegen by the acquisition (and judicious application) of knowledge.
**Personality—**Inquisitive to the point of being nosy, Greege ask a great deal of questions, and are usually wily enough to get the answers they seek through subtle queries that seem harmless enough when asked. Their curiosity is not just bound to knowledge, and Greege enjoy exploration and discovery as much, if not more, than they enjoy social manipulations.
**Physical Description—**Averaging 1.6 metres in height, Greege have figures roughly proportional to a human’s, with the addition of a second pair of arms slightly lower on their torsos. Greege are hairless, have powdery blue skin, and bright, slanted eyes with a mirror-like quality.
All Greege are double-jointed and capable of great feats of contortion.
A Greeg reaches physical maturity at age 18, and tend not to live beyond their 146th year.
**Homeworld—**Greegen, a world in Zanten Space. Greegen is a heavily built up world, with about 90% of its total landmass populated or industrialised.
**Example Names—**Aggai, Beege, Billig, Cagge, Deege, Dagge, Iggai, Megge, Oggai, Rillig.
**Adventurers—**Greege are drawn to a few fields over any others: politics, investigation, and espionage. They are also highly sought after as performers.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Greege Species Traits</span>
**Ability Modifiers—**+4 Dexterity, -2 Strength, -2 Constitution
**Medium Size—**as Medium creatures, Greege have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed—**Greege base speed is 6 squares.
**Fantastic Contortion—** a Greeg is capable of folding itself up to the size of a Small creature (and is treated as one when doing so), though its speed is reduced to 2 squares when doing so. The Greeg can also move through a square that would normally require it to squeeze without spending double movement.
**Four Limbs—**a Greeg has four hands. These hands may be used to manipulate equipment or wield weapons, and provide a +2 bonus to grapple checks. However, a Greeg cannot attack with more than one weapon in a single round unless he has a feat or talent that otherwise allows him to do so.
**Conditional bonus feat—**a Greeg with Acrobatics as a trained skill gains Skill Focus [Acrobatics] as a bonus feat.
**Automatic Languages—**Basic and Greege.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Odara</span>
The Odara (singular “Odara”) are a race of humanoids from Oda, a planet in the Outer Rim, several hundred light years from the edge of the Core. They are not dissimilar to humans in personality and temperament, with the same drive to explore and overcome. Odara settlers are a common sight on many planets.
Odara were great hunters before their inclusion into the galactic community, and the tradition still lives on. The skills are taught to Odara youths and practiced diligently so that they can succeed at the Great Hunt, a rite of passage that involves the successful tracking of a Filnir, a mammalian predator native to Oda. Odara youths from off-world have to make a pilgrimage to Oda as part of their Great Hunt. Slaying the Filnir used to be a requirement, but now there are too many young Odara and not enough of the beasts, so the requirement is now to shoot the Filnir with a tracker keyed to the hunter’s ident.
**Personality—**Odara tend to be tenacious and courageous, true companions and trusted friends. They tend to see the endeavours they embark on in terms of a hunt—the goal is their “prey”, and they plan the steps necessary to reach it with the same methodology they would apply to tracking an animal through the forests of Oda.
**Physical Description—**Rangy humanoids that average 2 metres in height, Odara share many characteristics with humans, including a roughly equivalent physiology, but are strikingly different to look upon. Their torsos are comparatively petite while their limbs can be as much as twice again the length of a human’s. An Odara has two long, downy antennae extending from its forehead, hair as fine—and as translucent—as gossamer, an aquiline nose, and a small mouth with thin lips. Odara skin tones range from lavender to mottled brown, while their irises tend to be brown, grey, or milky white.
An Odara sees as well as a human in normal light, but has sharper senses in dim light in addition to acute extrasensory awareness thanks to its antennae, which read vibrations in the air. Unsurprisingly, their culture has long focused on hunting.
Odara reach physical maturity at around age 16, and most live no longer than 120 years.
**Homeworld—**Oda, an Outer Rim world. Oda is a temperate world with two moons, comprised of about 40% forest, 40% sea, and 20% grasslands.
**Example Names—**Alia, Ana, Birr, Boli, Dai, Dema, Gali, Gini, Lill, Lonn, Lorr, Mai, Mia, Odi, Odia, Odil, Ran, Rill.
**Adventurers—**Odara can be found in many fields, but gravitate to roles where their courage and hunter’s prowess can be best utilised. Odara adventurers may be police, investigators, bounty hunters, or military scouts.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Odara Species Traits</span>
**Ability Modifiers—**+2 Wisdom, -2 Constitution
**Medium Size—**as Medium creatures, Odara have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed—**Odara base speed is 6 squares.
**Heightened Awareness—**an Odara may choose to reroll any Perception check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse.
**Low-light Vision—**Odara ignore concealment (but not total concealment) from darkness.
**Conditional bonus feat—**an Odara with Initiative as a trained skill gains Skill Focus [Initiative] as a bonus feat.
**Weapon Familiarity—**Odara with the Weapon Proficiency [rifles] feat are proficient with the blastbow.
**Automatic Languages—**Basic and Odara.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Veshi</span>
The Veshi (singular “Vesh”) hail from the water world Vesha at the edge of the Core Systems. Despite being natives to the water, with the aid of breathing apparatus and sight-enhancing technology they are at no disadvantage on dry land, and have made many contributions to the galaxy in fields as diverse as technology, art, and military tactics.
It is the last of these that many Veshi hold with the highest esteem. As a species they like to champion causes, and the young of Vesha have taken part in every military campaign ever embarked on by the Unified Galactic Forces. Over time their culture has adapted to emphasise and revere the qualities of soldiers and officers. Even those young Veshi who do not join the military typically go into corollary fields, such as engineering.
**Personality—**Veshi tend to be proud and honourable, brave and wilful.
**Physical Description—**Veshi average at 1.6 metres with stocky builds. They have smooth, slightly bulbous heads reminiscent of an octopus body—though their orange eyes, which possess a nictating membrane, are set in the front—and six prehensile tentacles grow from below their chin, concealing the gills in their neck. Though these can be moved by the Veshi, and are actually the means by which Veshi communicate underwater (“Veshi tentaclespeak”) by default they writhe around each other and form something very like a human’s beard. Fashion conscious Veshi wear rings on their tentacles. A Veshi’s three-digit hands and feet are webbed.
Veshi reach physical maturity at around age 22 and can live as long as 280.
**Homeworld—**Vesha is a water world on the edge of the Core Systems. Most Veshi live below the waves, but several platform cities were built to facilitate travel and trade to other planets.
**Example Names—**Beeleb, Cilgho, Illeen, Olaba, Runab.
**Adventurers—**Veshi make careers as soldiers, officers, or in military service corps.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Veshi Species Traits</span>
**Ability Modifiers—**+2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, -2 Dexterity
**Medium Size—**as Medium creatures, Veshi have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed—**Veshi base speed is 6 squares.
**Breathe Underwater—**Veshi can’t drown in water.
**Expert Swimmer—**a Veshi may choose to reroll any Swim check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse. In addition, Veshi may choose to take 10 on Swim checks even when distracted or threatened.
**Low-light Vision—**Veshi ignore concealment (but not total concealment) from darkness underwater. Above water, the Veshi’s goggles compensate to provide the same ability.
**Special Equipment—**Above water, Veshi cannot breathe and their eyes are not adapted to the quality of light. Without protective goggles, a Veshi is considered blind (see SECR pg 254). Without an AquaFilter breath mask, a Veshi begins to suffocate (see Endurance, SECR pg 66). A replacement mask costs 2,000 credits (500 on Vesha), and a year’s supply of filters costs 200 credits (50 on Vesha). Veshi characters begin play with these items at no cost.
An AquaFilter breath mask functions by filtering oxygen through a constant water cycle and administers it to the Veshi via pressure sensitive suction valves over their gills. The mask itself covers the Veshi’s mouth and intelligently regulates flow based on the state of their breathing.
In the unlikely situation that a member of a nonaquatic and non-amphibious species attempts to wear an AquaFilter mask, they begin to drown, moving them -1 step on the condition track every round they wear it. If they fall unconscious wearing the mask, the next round they die.
**Conditional bonus feat—**a Veshi with Knowledge [Tactics] as a trained skill gains Skill Focus [Knowledge [Tactics]] as a bonus feat.
**Automatic Languages—**Basic, Veshi tentaclespeak (gesture only).
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Wottil</span>
The Wottil (singular “Wotti”) are a race of humanoids from Wott, a planet in the Outer Rim. They have tall, thin, angular bodies, and as a culture share a fascination with patterns, particularly those that involve angles—and especially diamonds—that expresses itself in their construction, their art, and everything else, to the point of obsession.
**Personality—**Wottil are friendly and easy-going, but tend to be naïve and even weak-willed.
**Physical Description—**Averaging about 2.1 metres tall, wottil have thin frames with sharply angular joints. Their heads are roughly diamond in shape.
Wottil reach physical maturity at age 30 and rarely live beyond 600.
**Homeworld—**Wott, a world in the Outer Rim. Wott has a sunny, tropical climate. The settlements of the Wottil are all designed according to their obsession with angles, arranged into easily navigated blocks square or diamond in shape.
**Example Names—**Izi, Jav, Jex, Jez, Kin, Kiv, Kizi, Qiv, Qix, Qiz, Tavi, Vev, Vex, Xax, Zin
**Adventurers—**Most Wottil gravitate to peaceful and logical pursuits such as medicine or engineering.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Wottil Species Traits</span>
**Ability Modifiers—**+2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom, -2 Constitution
**Medium Size—**as Medium creatures, Wottil have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed—**Wottil base speed is 6 squares.
**Intuitive Initiative—**a Wotti may choose to reroll any Initiative check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse.
**See the Pattern—**Choose one of either Diplomat or Warrior.
***Diplomat—***you quickly come to understand the patterns behind the words expressed by those around you, giving you a great insight that works in your
favour. You may reroll any failed Persuasion check. You must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.
***Warrior—***when in a combat you see the shape of your foes’ tactics. You can expend a swift action on your turn to allow an ally within line of sight to make the following reaction, if they choose (and in place of any other reaction they might otherwise make) at any point before the Wotti’s next turn—
AS A REACTION, when an enemy moves you may move up to your speed directly toward or away from them by the simplest, most risk-free route. You may choose to act before, after, or during their move action. If your movement interrupts theirs and you block their route, and if there is no alternative path available to them that does not invite danger or provoke from you or an ally, their movement is halted prematurely in the last safe square.
Additionally, you can spend an action point to allow yourself or an ally within line of sight to reroll any failed check made as a reaction. The second result must be accepted, even if worse.
**Automatic Languages—**Basic, Wottil.

## Re: Four potential species?

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-21 19:47:19)

Hell, might as well add the Quasrene (from Ripples in the Deep) as well.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Quasrene</span>
The quasrene [kwas-rain] are natives of the icy planet Quasre.
A quasren [kwas-ran] has a similar build to a human, though on average they are shorter and stockier. They have naturally muscular frames, particularly on their torso, and because of this scientists believe they evolved from burrowing creatures. They are covered in soft and downy white fur that keeps them warm and preserves their modesty, and the lack of necessity for them to wear clothing allows them to take advantage of styles that would seem skimpy and indecent on other species. Quasrene like to express individuality by dying their fur (completely or in patterns), and cutting the longer hair that grows from their head and down the nape of their neck to the shoulder blades into spiky styles that contrast with the silky smoothness of their fur.
It is often hard to find something to do on Quasre. This is less the case since contact was made between the quasrene and other species, since when they have been able to benefit from technology of a greater level than their own, however a lack of entertainment is still an issue on the planet. The species has had to find its own ways of entertainment. Of these, four are chief: sport, storytelling and song, arguing amongst themselves, and brawling. The first two help the quasrene pass time and have fun, while the latter are thought to be excellent ways to relieve tension. Though they know better than to initiate random conflict with offworlders, and when offworld themselves are often too interested in their exotic surroundings, sometimes a quasren's upbringing gets the better off them and they leap head first into trouble.
Despite this apparent lack of wisdom, quasrene are actually very social creatures. They may argue, and they may fight, but they usually do so to release tension rather than out of mutual enmity. These conflicts serve a social function, as do their regular entertainments and sporting events. Nothing is more important to a quasren, therefore, than the communal units they exist within. They form strong bonds of loyalty, trust, and friendship which they will not easily break. Those who betray a quasren when he or she has honoured them with such deep trust are unlikely ever to win it back.
Quasrene communicate as much with their body as they do with speech. Their fur ripples in complicated signals that demonstrate emotion and subtle shades of meaning. Used to watching for difficult physical tells, they often find members of other species terribly easy to read.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Quasrene Species Traits</span>

* Medium-sized.
* Base speed of 6 squares.
* +2 Strength. The Quasrene are evolved from burrowing creatures, and were once capable of breaking through the packed snow and ice of their home planet.
* -2 Wisdom. Though by no means foolish, the Quasrene are impetuous, especially when off their home planet and experiencing new things for the first time. They can also be temperamental, as arguments and fights are not uncommon on Quasre as a way to pass the time.
* Darkvision.
* A Quasren always treats Endurance as though it were on their class skill list.
* A Quasren gains a +5 bonus to checks versus extreme cold (see Extreme Temperatures on page 254 of the Saga Edition rulebook).
* **Analyse Tell:** When communicating, Quasren watch the subtle movements of the fur on their bodies as much as listening to any words spoken. They have become adept at comprehending the deeper meaning of physical tells, and associate the image of a speaker sent via the eyes to their brain with memories of past observations in order to discern patterns of behaviour. Quasren add their Intelligence bonus (if any) to Perception checks made to sense deception or sense influence (see page 70 of the Saga Edition rulebook).
