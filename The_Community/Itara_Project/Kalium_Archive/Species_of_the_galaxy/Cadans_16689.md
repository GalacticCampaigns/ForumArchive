# Cadans

Cadans are a species that live on the far side of the Kalium Galaxy, far away from the other inhabitents. The cadans though became very technologically advanced, and learned how to use this to their advantage. They have not met many species, but they regard species less intelligent than them with scorn. Recently they conquered a few lesser known species in the far reaches of the galaxy, and are formulating plans to conquer other species as well. Secretly creating the Reaping, a group of cyborgs and droids who operate like mercenaries, they gain valuable information on the military strength of other civilizations, as well as owning one of the strongest and widely feared military force in the galaxy.
**Personality**: Cadans are very blunt, not hesitent to tell you exactly what's wrong or what you've done wrong. It takes Cadans training to be polite and diplomatic. Cadans are also incredible inventors, and are knowledgable with technology of all kinds.
**Physical Description**: Cadans are about human height, thin, and possess pale skin, giving them a corpse like appearance. Cadans live to be around 90-100 years old.
**Language**: Cadese, but many learn basic, and a few even learn the Reaping language.
**homeworld**: Cadasia, though many live on the other Cadan colonies.
**Adventurers**: Few Cadans leave their area in space, the ones that do are mainly scouts, scoundrels, and soldiers, most of them scouting the rest of the Kalium Galaxy.
**Ability Modifiers** +2 Intelligence -2 Constitution -2 Strength
Cadans are intelligent, but have weak bodies.
**Medium Size**: No bonus or penalties due to size
**Bonus Feat**: All Cadans gain skill training (knowledge (technology)) as a bonus feat, even if the skill is not on the character's class skills
**Diplomatically Challenged**: Cadans cannot make persuasion checks untrained, except to intimidate. Cadans never have persuasion as a class skill at first level, and can only gain it through an INT boost or skill training (as long as it would normally have been on their class skill list).
**Intelligent defense**: Cadans have learned how to harness their intelligence in battle, and so can substitute their INT bonus in place of their dex bonus in calculating their reflex defence
**Techonological Training**: Mechanics and Use computer are always class skills for a Cadan
**Automatic Languages**: Cadan
what's your thoughts on the stats? too weak, too strong?

With a bonus to Intelligence, and having that ability govern Reflex Defense and ranged attacks, as well as the normal Intelligence bonuses would be too much, methinks.
The Strength penalty doesn't do much for a species that leans that much to ranged combat, and I personally don't think Persuasion is that big a deal (especially since they can get it with a feat anyway). I would just give them a Charisma Penalty instead (that's in addition to the Constitiution penalty).
Other than that, they get two automatic class skills (Soldier and Scoundrel get both anyway) and two bonus feats (Knowledge[technology] is not a big deal, but WP [heavy weapons] can be). I think that it all might be a bit much.

so if I added the CHA penalty on top of all of it, you think it would be ok?

Perhaps change the "Intelligent fighting" trait to Intelligent Defense (replacing the Dexterity bonus to Reflex with their Intelligence bonus). This will keep the scientist race from being combat monsters, yet still grant them a boost in combat.
The training in Heavy Weapons confuse me, but that may just be my prejudice. They are a builder species, with nothing in their history saying anything implying every man, woman, and child being taught how to shoot a [heavy machine gun](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Twin_M2HB_machine_gun.jpg/140px-Twin_M2HB_machine_gun.jpg "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Twin_M2HB_machine_gun.jpg/140px-Twin_M2HB_machine_gun.jpg") or [missile launcher](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Redeye_Surface_to_Air_Missile_01.jpg/300px-Redeye_Surface_to_Air_Missile_01.jpg "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Redeye_Surface_to_Air_Missile_01.jpg/300px-Redeye_Surface_to_Air_Missile_01.jpg").
But you don't want to be the end all, be all of technology, hence why you aren't giving them a bonus to Mechanics. I actually like how you worked the Persuasion penalty, though I see **MoDaVader** 's point. Perhaps word "Diplomatically Challenged" something like: *Cadans cannot make persuasion checks untrained, except to intimidate. Cadans never have Persuasion as a class skill, even if it's on their class skill list. Instead, they must that the feat Skill Training (Persuasion) in order to be trained in that skill.* This way it actually has a cost beyond first level.
Bonus to a stat, and then an ability that uses that stat? Your looking at a 3rd level soldier with a +10 (+6 Intelligence, plus BAB and Weapon Focus) to his attack bonus with his blaster rifle. That same soldier with the armored defense tree & a armored space suit will have a Reflex defense of 19, without spending feats. That's...a bit much, added together.
So, my opinion, is to leave the stats as they are, drop the Heavy Weapon training, reword the Persuasion thing, and make the Intelligence bonus to Reflex defense only. That would be a lot closer to what you were looking for, I hope.

you've got a point about the intelligent fighting, I'll change that. hmm, It seems like they are still missing something though. I'm not sure yet
Revised Version
+2 Intelligence -2 Constitution -2 Strength
Cadans are intelligent, but have weak bodies.
Medium Size: No bonus or penalties due to size
Bonus Feat: All Cadans gain skill training (knowledge (technology)) as a bonus feat, even if the skill is not on the character's class skills
Diplomatically Challenged: Cadans cannot make persuasion checks untrained, except to intimidate. Cadans never have persuasion as a class skill at first level, and can only gain it through an INT boost or skill training (as long as it would normally have been on their class skill list).
Intelligent defense: Cadans have learned how to harness their intelligence in battle, and so can substitute their INT bonus in place of their dex bonus in calculating their reflex defence
Techonological Training: Mechanics and Use computer are always class skills for a Cadan

Hmm, that's definitely better balanced, and seems to fit better with the species presented in the rule books. I like Intelligent Defense so much more this way as it seems to fit the species much better.
One thing, about Diplomatically Challenged: Barring a house rule, characters can only train in a skill if it's a class skill, so they'd never have access to Persuasion, even with an Intelligence boost or the Skill Training feat.
And I still think a Charisma penalty works better than your species trait, but that's just my opinion.

I added another part to the ability
i think another stat penalty is extreme
They get a stat bonus, that allows them to make a dump stat, 3 weak bonuses (most classes have use comp and mechanics) and knowledge isn't overly useful (it might be if crafting uses knowledge), 2 major physical penalties, and a middle-class penalty.
After seeing kotor, I believe species should be positive oriented (as in more bonuses than penalties), but it's true that getting a bonus to range attacks is too much.

I see your point, but something about the ability just doesn't sit right with me. I don't know, maybe it's just me . . .

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-14 18:16:36)

well, I based it off a similar penalty to a species on Saga-edition.com

Diplomatically Challenged: Cadans cannot make persuasion checks untrained, except to intimidate. Cadans never have persuasion as a class skill *<strong>at first level</strong>*, and can only gain it through an INT boost or skill training (as long as it would normally have been on their class skill list).
Does that solve it?
Means they have to multi-class into Noble or Scoundrel before it becomes a class skill.
