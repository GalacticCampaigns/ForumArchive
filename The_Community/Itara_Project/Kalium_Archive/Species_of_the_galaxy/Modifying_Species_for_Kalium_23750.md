# Modifying Species for Kalium

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-21 18:31:09)

Are there any species that people don't want touched?  My ideas usually take the form of some species from the Lucas-verse, but changing them around a bit.  Still, I don't want to mess with the Humans or the Wookiees.  Are there any other species that people would prefer got left alone?  Excepting the ones already posted, of course.

I would have said don't mess with the Nautolan race, but you already did....

Oops.Â  Well, I haven't gotten a reply on it yet, so I can change it to, say, Mon Calamari.Â  I haven't submitted it yet, so I can make as many changes as I (or anybody else) wants . . .
Edit: I never noticed Avarna's post.  Guess I should keep better track of these things.

Mess with wookies.Â  They over over the top, and only that cool because Chewbacca was cool.
Plus, the whole "have claws, but won't use them in a fight" thing bugs me to no end.Â  Plus "peaceful and compassionate" does not mix well with a rage species trait, and generations of oppression and slavery.Â  I'd rather see "well known for their anger" under those circumstances.
One voice among many.

its okay I'll post stuff there about what i think needs some work.
I agree with Breeder. Mess with the wookies. I think reading something like "the wookiee ripped the troopers head off with their claws and then proceeded to taste the dead trooper to see because she thought it would make a good stew"
Now I personally would love to see some one mess with Humans.... I think they need messed with any how. Humans should be a minority in this galaxy and looked down upon by the other races. but thats just my thought.

Hmm, I guess there's a bigger vote for messing with the Wookiees.  Well, if you want to, I'd like to see what you come up with.  I probably won't like it, but I'd still like to see what you can do.  As for the Humans, having them be a minority is a good idea, but stat-wise, they shouldn't be messed with.  Statting up a new, near-Human race is fine, but I don't think you should play with their stats.  Just my opinion, anyway.

IÂ´m going to throw my vote in NOT to mess with the wookies. I think wookies are great just the way they are, and they are one of my favourite species all categories in SW.
IÂ´d also like to say, mess alittle with the Noghri. Leave all non-mechanical aspects of the species alone, but their game statistics could be reworked.

I wasn't going to do much with humans maybe something like
**insignificant:** Since most other races believe humans are inferior to them and unable to do any thing worth noticing. they tend to not pay much attention to their actives. as such a human can reroll any stealth check, but must accept the second roll even if it is worse.
and then do something to balance it out

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-27 17:48:32)

That's actually sounds cool.  That might work.  You could just use that ability to replace their bonus feat and that should take care of any balance issues.

There goes my idea for making wookies into cannibals...
I'll try to work on it. Making wookies Kalium yet keeping with all the cool stuff that makes them wookies will be interesting. If I ever get it posted, I want some very pointed commetns fromyou.

Will work on this too. I like little assassins.
