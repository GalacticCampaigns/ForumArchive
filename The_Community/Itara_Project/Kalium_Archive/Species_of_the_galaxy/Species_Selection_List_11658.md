# Species Selection List

### **Rowen** (2008-05-24 23:05:41)

This will be a running post for species you would like added. When the time comes to add more species I would like a large repository for people to choose from.

> You have to have the Hutts.

Actually...I was thinking about suggesting the [Baragwin](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Baragwin "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Baragwin") to fill the role of the Hutts as master crime lords. Already, they are master arms dealers in the Galaxy Far, Far Away, and they were there when humans first reached the stars, munitions in hand and a good deal brewing in their minds.

That's not a bad idea, but I still like the Hutts. Maybe not as crime lords, though. [Beldorian](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Beldorion "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Beldorion") was a Jedi before he turned to the dark side. This galaxy could be policed by his descendents (or those of other Hutt Jedi, if there ever were any).

That's not a bad idea either.
I like hutts, and I like the idea of a force using hutt. But...I dunno about Jedi. I believe you are thinking of the normal Jedi, and not the Kalium Jedi- of which we have yet to decide anything about. Now...Dark Side Maruder sytle Force using hutt? Running either his own police force or crimal gang? Now that is an idea I can get behind.
Oh, just in case you didn't know, I really have no more say in the creation of the Kalium Galaxy than any other person. I'm just the loudest and most talkitive one at this time.

Well, sorta. I was thinking of them as descendants of the Jedi from the Lucas Galaxy, whatever that means for the Kalium galaxy.

Actually, yeah, that's close to what I was thinking. See the thread I'm starting about them -- this way I don't have to repeat it all.

Yeah, I got that. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> But I like working with those who are loud and talkative. Without your suggestion for the Baragwin as crime lords I might never have thought of the Hutts as Force-users, and I'm really liking that idea.
