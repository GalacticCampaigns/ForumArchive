# The Reaping

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 13:54:58)

The Reaping arenâ€™t really a species, as anyone can become a Reaping. The Reaping are created through advanced cybernetic and droid alterations made to the person, making them more machine than man. The Reaping operate as mercenaries, though in reality they are the servants of the Cadans. This is a very well kept secret though. The Reaping though are held with restraining bolts and droid callers to ensure their loyalty.
**Personality**: The Reaping are generally very aggressive, and very unfriendly, as the changes to their body affect the chemical connections of their brain.
**Physical Description**:Their appearance can vary, as it depends on what species they were originally, but what is usually common is a disturbing arrangement of droid and cybernetic parts mixed with flesh, giving them a monstrous appearance.
**Homeworld**: Reaping publically have no homeworld, but all Reaping were created on Cadasia.
**Languages**: The reaping mainly speak whatever languages they had before becoming Reaping, though the Reaping have created a language, also called Reaping, made up of a mix and match of Cadese, Basic, and Binary.
**Reaping**
**Ability Modifiers**: +4 strength *or* +2 Strength and +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, -2 wisdom, -2 Charisma. The Reaping have gained great physical strength, but at the cost of their bodies, will power, and appearance. Ability Modifiers are added on top of what the original characterâ€™s ability scores (as no character is born like this, but is made so through cybernetic surgery)
**Speed**: Is speed of the original creature
**Size**: Is size of the original creature
**Cyborg Hybrid**: As page 177 of Force Unleashed Campaign Guide. Reaping automatically gain restraining bolts, droid callers, and improved sensor package for free.
**Conditional Bonus Feat**: A Reaping trained in endurance gain Extra Second Wind feat, stemming from their modifications giving them the ability to boost their appendages more times than the normal organic.
 **Zero-power**: As a swift action, a Reaping may shut down his/her droid power (and so can't use any droid systems or built-in weapons), but oppenents take a -5 penalty to detect a Reaping in Zero-power mode using electronic sensors of any kind (vehicle sensors, droids, using a sensor pack). Does not affect using normal sight or hearing.
**Reaping creation:**
To become a reaping, someone must perform cybernetic installation on you (and you can't do so on yourself) and the DC is increased to 40. If you the surgery fails, you take damage equal to your 5 x the amount the person failed the DC by. Reviving a creature killed this way becomes more difficult, increasing the DC to revivify by 5, and increasing by 5 each subsequent attempt afterwards as well (when done after being killed through this surgery only)

I like it <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
IÂ´ve always been thinking that it would be nice to have more advanced options for cybernethics/genetic mutation, although somehow it never seemed very fit for the original SW Galaxy. But this is our Galaxy.
That said, I donÂ´t think something like this should be set in stone as for traits, but rather done a little more like Arkanian offshoots are stated in the KOTOR guide. Various class features depending on what they have been engineered for.

hmm, that is an interesting idea.
though it might be a problem to give someone a choice between +4 str and +4 dex

How about not making it an extreme +4? Instead give them a +2 in an attribute, and a related ability such as skill training in an attribute-related skill. For Dexterity it could be Initiative or Acrobatics, and for Strength Climb, Jump or Swim. For Intelligence, you could say they get an automatic Memory Implant, and for Constitution you could keep the conditional bonus feat they have now.
Also, the relations between what cybernethics causes what drawbacks could vary. All alternations could give -2 Charisma due to some loss of humanity, and -2 to Wisdom due to loss of Willpower.
Then increased Intelligence or Dexterity could cause a -4 loss in Wisdom since the insertion of a more computerized brain/more rapid moving limbs could mean increased distractions and problems for their mind to focus.

seems a little over complicated, but I'll give it some thought
I changed it to just +2 str and +2 dex, instead of having a choice.

DidnÂ´t you know? ThatÂ´s my job at these forums. I post something overcomplicated and then we all works together to make it nice and simple :

lol, ok then.
anyways, disregard my edit, as I changed it back to the choice. I'm too indecisive

And I like this, too. I say- and everyone knows I really run this place, and Rowan is merely my figure head, so my voice overwhelms all- this is he way it should be done.
I'm wondering if there is a sarcastic font I could use...
