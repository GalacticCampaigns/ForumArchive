<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ubese</span>
The Ubese are newcomers to the larger galaxy, lithe and almost always covered by their environmental suits. It's a rare occurance to find a ubese not out of such a suit, and when they are it's obvious they're fond of extensive cybernetic implants.
History: 500 years ago the Ubese stood at the dawn of a new age, sciene and technology were advancing at an exponential rate and their young species underwent a technological singularity where they quickly gained technologies they had only dreamed of a few years prior. The most impressive of these was artifical intelligence capable of self awareness and improvement, and able to manage tasks which would otherwise take a full team of Ubese attendants. This lead to a rapid increase in the productivity of Uba's industry and allowed them to finally produce space craft capable of travelling at FTL speeds.
The world was wreathed with fire and the atmosphere was laced with deadly toxins as the first ships took to the stars. The AI which the Ubese had come to rely on so heavily had suddenly attempted to wipe them from the very planet itself, damaging the atmosphere so severely that it is still in the same condition today. Other than killing almost 70% of the population the corrupted atmpshere now rendered laser weapons useless and with it the majority of the Uba's military.
During the months that followed the Ubese had to change themselves to survive the now hostile surface, they resorted to cybernetics. First enhancing their respiratory systems and vision out of necessity they eventually turned to using them in combat applications. The military eventually managed to manufacture enough slugthrower weapons to launch a concerted assault against the Ai. A bloody but short war followed and the Ubese could finally focus on rebuilding. AI were unaminously outlawed by the surviving city Governors and all machinery would now be controlled manually by ubese operators.
50 years ago the Ubese managed to once more manucfacture spacecraft capable of FTL travel, and this time they became a member of the larger galaxy.
Personality: Ubese are focused individuals who share a universal hatred of droids and in fact anything with artificial intelligence. They feel burdened with ensuring the rest of the galaxy doesn't suffer the same fate as their world.
Physiology: Ubese are slender looking near humans with fair skin. Eyes are commonly grey or blue whilst all ubese share the same narrow faces with high cheekbones, they are completely hairless. All ubese have cybernetic implants, older Ubese have extensive internal implants which were needed to survive the ruined planet, whilst younger ubese grew up inside sealed shelters meaning their bodies weren't as badly damaged as too need multiple organ replacements. They universally rely on respiratory implants however and also wear environmental suits preferring not to take any chances.
Homeworld: Uba is a mid rim world mostly covered in ocean with a few larger islands dotted near volcanic areas, these islands generally have a large city each. Many of the cities lie ruined or abandoned including the old capital city of Urii of which now only a crater remains.
Language: Ubese speak basic and Ubese.

Ubese Species Traits</span>
Ability Modifiers: -2 Constitution +2 Dexterity. Ubese physiology has been ravaged by their homeworld but they are gifted with fast reflexes and agility.
Size: Ubese are medium creatures.
Speed: Ubese have a base speed of 6 squares
Droid Hatred: Whenever a Ubese hits a droid with an attack, they gain a +2 bonus on the damage roll. This works at starship scale when attacking droid controlled fighters.
Mechanical Aptitude: The ubese have come to rely on technology so much that the younger generation are schooled in it's basic applications. Mechanics is always a class skill for a Ubese character.
Special Equipment: All ubese have respiratory implants which have the same effects as a breath mask, they never have to replace the canisters however. These implants are free, most ubese also wear an environmental suit as a precaution, though it's not needed for survival.
Free Languages: Basic and Ubese.

This is a pretty interesting adaptation of the Ubese. You seem to have both fundamentally changed the species and provided a new statblock. I suppose I have to ask in light of the fact that the only similarities are the species name and physical appearance, if it wouldn't make sense to take the reinvention a step further and rewrite them as a new species unique to Kalium?

Maybe, but I like Ubese as a name. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
