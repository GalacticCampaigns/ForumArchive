**Lasani**
**Ability Modifiers**: Lasani have no ability score adjustments
**Medium Size**
**Speed**: 6 squares
**Efficient Body Systems**: Lasani are naturally good at surviving with little food and water. A Lasani can go 5 times their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before he/she needs to make Endurance checks to ignore hunger and ignore thirst.
**Bonus Feat**: Many poisonous plants grow in the Great Sea of Sand, and Lasani have developed a natural resistance to the poison. Lasani gain Poison Resistance as a bonus feat.
**Bonus Feat**: Lasani have learned how to efficiently search for abandoned materials and ores to use, as such things are difficult to find naturally in the desert. Lasani gain Scavenger as a bonus feat.
**Automatic Languages**: Lasanti
**Personality**: While very few people have even met a Lasani, a Lasaniâ€™s personality can vary greatly, as there is no set standard. Lasani tend though to be somewhat curious about things.
**Physical Description**: Lasani are dark skinned, thin creatures, with small eyes. Everything about them is suited to surviving in a desert.
**Homeworld**: The homeworld of the Lasani is Jherit.
The Lasani are a species indigenous to Jherit. Virtually unknown, the Lasani have evolved in peace. Their great curiosity has caused them to send out scouts searching the desert, leading them to discover advanced technology that had been abandoned in the desert. Bringing back what pieces they could, they eventually discovered how it worked, though at the time they didnâ€™t have the resources to replicate any more than a handful of weapons and devices. Constantly searching for mineral deposits that exist on the border of the desert and the mountains, and wrecks of vehicles that happen from time to time, the Lasani have been able to make quite a few weapons and devices, having slugthrowers, blasters, and even computers. These weapons and objects are difficult to replace though, and are valued greatly in Lasani society. Lasani treat anything new cautiously, studying it with great curiosity, then deciding whether to keep it, leave it behind, or destroy it. This goes for how the Lasani treat strangers as well, though it would be rare for them to kill a stranger.

Nice! One question, though, about the Efficient Body Systems ability. No length of time is specified. Is it days? Weeks? Months?

It's meant to be dependant on whether your ignoring thirst, or ignoring hungar.
you can ignore thirst for a number of hours = to your CON mod, ignore hungar for a number of days = to your CON mod
the ability simply multiplies that time by five (but automatically allows you to ignore thirst 5 hours or more, and hunger 5 days or more).

A build that doesn't have adjustments to attributes, just feats: I think that's awsome. Great job. With so much focus on stats and build it looks like you put some energy into the concept. Again great job. I'd want to play one of these just because of the conceptualizing you've presented. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
