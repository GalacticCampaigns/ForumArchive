<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">**Kel Dor**</span>
Kel Dor have changed in the Kalium Galaxy, they grew more attuned to the force, and all Kel Dor can hear its call now. Kel Dor have the ability to deal a more damaging blow than other species by using the force to guide their attacks. Kel Dor also have slowed a bit, but have gained greater strength than their counterparts from the other galaxy. Their masks and goggles are not as advanced as the ones in the other galaxy, and arenâ€™t as effective in darkness. Currently many Kel Dor become Bendu monks, focusing on unarmed combat and the ability to look into the future. While not all Kel Dor become Bendu monks, the ones that do generally become the most powerful Kel Dor, as the training allows them to focus their natural abilities. Few kel Dor become Jedi or Sith, but Itâ€™s not unheard of.
**Personality**: Kel Dor are much more stoic, and display little emotion. Kel Dor also do not believe in simple justice (as this caused many young Kel Dor to fall to the dark side)
**Physical Description**: The average Kel Dor stands between 1.6 and 2 meters tall. They have bulky muscles, and skin color ranging from peach to deep red. Most have black eyes.
**Homeworld**: The homeworld of the Kel Dor is the heavily forested, mountainous planet Driona.
**Ability Modifiers**: +2 Strength, +2 Wisdom, -2 Consitution
**Medium Size**
**Speed**: 6 squares
**Bonus Feat**: Force Sensitive
**Battle Strike**: Once per encounter a Kel Dor can make an untrained Use the force check to activate the Battle Strike power. A Kel Dor who takes the Force Training Feat automatically adds a single use of the Battle Strike power to his/her force power suite (for free) instead of this ability.
**Low-light vision**: see Kel Dor special ability on page 28 of SECR
**Special Equipment**: see page 28 of SECR.
**Automatic Languages**: Basic and Kel Dor

While I am quite fond of the old, peaceful, seer Kel Dor, this doesnÂ´t seem too bad to me. I donÂ´t know about automatic Force Sensitivity, but you could keep the Battle Strike ability and add another ability doing the same thing, but with the Farseeing power.
Also, I donÂ´t think their low-ligt vision in the old Galaxy comes from their goggles, so I think they should keep it.

well, if they don't get force sensitivity, they can't make untrained utf checks :P
I'll look into the low-light vision thing though

Well, you can always make an exception

simpler just to give them force sensitivity don't you think?

Simpler yes, but my point was that perhaps they shouldnÂ´t be naturally gifted in all aspects of the Force, but be able to touch it in a few limited ways.

I disagree, if you look at the felucians (which I based their abliities off of) you'll see they get it for free, and the shamans don't really focus on all aspects anyways. Also, unless they take it as a trained skill (not all will) they can only touch it in limited ways

I have no problem with an entire species of Force Sensitives (you've seen my Hutts). However, this should be very, very rare. Hutts and Kel Dor are okay (and probably the Miraluka), but any more than that would probably overdo it.
And while I am particularly fond of the old Kel Dor (my second favorite race), this version isn't so bad. I do have one question, about their personality. What did you mean by "Kel Dor also do not believe in simple justice (as this caused many young Kel Dor to fall to the dark side)?"
And I really like the idea of the Kel Dor as Bendu monks. I thought Breeder's description of the monks was particularly suited to your version of them.

well, the Kel Dor originally (and the george lucas galaxy kel dor still do) believed in simple justice (you steal from me, I kill you, like a hyped up hammarubi whoever you spell that code). But because in this galaxy all kel dor are attuned to the force, such acts brought many kel dor to the dark side. And so the leaders changed their views on it. It also fits in with the Bendu monk personality

Ah, so the Kel Dor just don't take an extreme stance on the issue of justice. Do they have any justice code? It could be interesting if they didn't.
Oh, and you were close. It's spelled Hammurabi.

I hate it.  Like I hate that rock that always works its way into your shoe while your one a five mile run.
I'd rather see a separate ability, perhaps a conditional feat/power, that boosts a Force based power or provides the same thing as a a Force power, than see yet another race with automatic access to a discipline everyone else has to work work.  Especially since if you mess up using the force, you become very, very evil.
But, that's me.
