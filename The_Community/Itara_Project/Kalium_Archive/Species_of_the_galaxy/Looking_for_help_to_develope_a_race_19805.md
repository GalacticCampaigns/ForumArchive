# Looking for help to develope a race

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-21 00:40:53)

I have an idea for a race and I am looking for ideas to make it possible.
The idea is a race that is in a genetic decline, sort of a reverse evolution. I don't know enough science to make it believable though.
Some of the basic ideas I had, the discovery is recent, say the last few hundred years, and the evidence is physical in nature, larger heads or extra molars coming back in several generations of children. You get the idea.
Let the ideas begin!

I've been thinking about the personality of the race in general and I have decided to use an optomistic, "we have lots of time to get this fixed and plenty of resources to do it'", attitude.
Of course a race that knows it's dying will have death cults, religious fanatics, conspiracy organizations, and groups who are in absolute denial.
The general population takes the same stance that we take on any major event that has many, many years until we see the effects: "Who cares we have lots of time and plenty of resources to fix it. Besides, it won't effect me while I'm alive." "It took thousands of millenia to get where we are, so it will take thousands more to where we don't want to be."

I have also been thinking about a reason for the decline, and this is what I came up with:
1) A germ that was dormant or slowly gestating until recently, was caused by a BIO/CHEM war thousands of years ago.
2) The race itself has become unattuned to the Force some how, I haven't read enough Star Wars books to know how or if this is possible.
3) They are actually a race of Clone off spring. The Clone ancestors had been given the ability to reproduce in a similar fashion to their non-Clone creators, and the genetic coding is starting to break down. Of course they do not know any of this, or do they? Maybe there is someone who does, who is not of this species, and they are trying to use it to their advantage.
4) Of course the best one: it's all a conspiracy. Many, many ideas with this one.

I think your headed in the right direction with this. There are a couple of the reasons I wouldn't use.
The unattuning to the force would not cause this effect, the Yuuzhan Vang fit into that description. But I don't think it would cause a genetic reversal.
The clone off spring I don't think would fly due to the fact that all clones quickly perished and I don't think even any offspring would stay genetically stable long enough to produce an entire race.
Now Bio/Chem alterations due to warfare between them and another race is HIGHLY plausible. It could have even been a mistake while attempting to invent a new Bio/Chem weapon, a lab accident if you will.
Thats just my take so far. I like the idea, keep the idea's rolling.

Very cool! Thank you for the constructive help.
The crockpot of ideas is continuing to simmer, more to come when I'm a little less tired.

The idea presented in Stargate SG-1 (copy of a copy of a copy of a what was that originally anyway?) is neat and could work but has the been done quality too it. Do it better? Sure. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
The Vedians from Star Trek: Voyager having a persistant necrotizing infection that forced an otherwise artisitic and benevolent species to turn to bio harvesting of other sapients to survive. Neat one that. The episode of an unconsious pregnant woman spasming on a medical table as her body (& likely her unborn child) is being ripped apart, likely an organ at a time, was one of the most disturbing sci-fi and television moments I've seen. Still causes me to shiver when I think about it. : brrr!
For a "dying race that knows it's dying" I like the idea presented in an episode of Star Trek: Enterprise better, that of a natural genetic degredation. They're not sure of the origin but it's progressive with each generation and debilitating. Mutations. Systemic failure. Mental & physcal like poorly bred chattle (interesting angle that). Their base genetic structure is unstable and falling apart. Crash research projects could result in any number of drastic corner cutting to fight the panic of their impending doom. The results of that would provide much fluff. A society that's falling apart because the people themselves are falling apart. <!-- s:! -->![:!](https://i.ibb.co/0VpSwssk/icon-e-surprised.gif)<!-- s:! -->:

Cool,thank you for the input! I was certain there would be references from Sci-fi shows. Other than a couple first season episodes of the two ST shows and periodic backgroud noise from SG-1 when I forget to change the channel, I haven't watched any of these shows in great detail.

I haven't abandodned this one yet. I am still looking into playability and story ideas.

### **Rebaav** (2008-11-15 13:32:22)

Sure thing. Did you think of where you wanted to take them or start them from? Any of the suggested starting points or one of your own?

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-15 14:59:12)

possible penalties for the race could include:
-2 CON
-5 fort against diseases and radiation
low life span
or any combination of other things that have to do with low survivabilty.

For some reason all the cool ideas I had for this thread have left me. I should learn to write them down. For now this thread is dead.
Feel free to delete it.:x

My two cents:
A race in decline, dying off. As a species, it has reached its height and now is in steady decline. People are losing hope. Population growth has slowed, stalled, then became negative (the rate in which babies are born is lower than the rate people are dying). Diseases, plagues, and other ailments are running rampant through the species. Memories of feats the species was capable in its hay day are now only reminders of what they have lost.
The government, having tried everything, still puts on a good face, encouraging their people to have hope, even when there is none. All manner of things have been tried to arrest the fall of the species: cloning, artificial pregnancies, genetic manipulation, cybernetics (interesting cross over with the Reaping here), and more.
Darker things could exist, as well. Developing psychic (Force) powers to possess others, ripping the mind of healthy species out and replacing them with this species, the grafting of one genetic strain to others...an entire species is trying to save itself; no taboo is strong enough to stop these attempts.
Death Cults and the other, darker aspects of religion would rear their ugly heads. Cults dedicated to a "taking the rest of the galaxy with us" mindset. Some cults would sabotage attempts to help. Some would seek stasis chambers, walling themselves off from the galaxy, in hopes later a cure could be found. Perhaps organizations dedicated to protecting these closed off people would develop.
But there would be a few hopefuls. Those that live like they are going to live forever, embracing the brightest aspects of their curse, embodying the greatest of their ancestors, becoming tragic lights in a galaxy of darkness.
Driven. I see this species as very much aware their clock is ticking, and whatever they hope to accomplish, they have to do it soon. Their will to succeed, be it the fruition of a death cult, or new and improved methods of cloning, would be beyond that of anyone else.
That's all I got for now. Hope it helps spawn a few ideas.

Very appreciated, lots of cool ideas. I had thought about the death cults and anti-survival organizations. Might go that route.

[Children of Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/plotsummary "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/plotsummary") is a movie you might be interested in. Good flick, and all about a humanity that can't breed any more.
