**Zabrak**
**Ability Modifiers**: -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma. Zabrak are confident and this helps them gather followers, but sometimes have a lack of good judgement.
Medium Size
**Speed**: 6 squares
**Great Fortitude**: Zabraks have gained a stronger resistance to diseases and radiation, and so gain a +2 species bonus to Fortitude defense.
**Determination**: Zabraks believe they can do anything, and this allows them to succeed when others would fail. Once per encounter, they can reroll one failed skill check with a trained skill. This reroll can be declared after success or failure of the roll is known. The Zabrak must take the result of this second roll. A skill check is considered a failure only when the check fails to meet the minimum DC for any kind of success.
**Weapon Familiarity**: Zabrak treat the Zhaboka as an advanced melee weapon instead of exotic.
**Automatic Languages**: Basic and Zabrak
The Zabrak are known to live by the phrase â€œIf youâ€™ve failed, it means you havenâ€™t tried enough.â€ This motivates them to try as hard as they can in everything they do. The Zabrak are famous for being able to do almost anything, and this causes other species to rally behind Zabrak. There have been many Zabrak politicians, military leaders, and scientists who have made a difference in society thanks to their â€œanythingâ€™s possibleâ€ attitude. A Zabrak has been involved in almost every major event in the galaxy.
**Personality**: Zabrak tend to be very determined and try to overcome any obstacle they face. Zabrak also have a confidence about them that draws others to them.
**Physical Description**: Humanoid, distinguished by patterns of vestigial horns atop their heads. About 1.8 meters tall on average.
**Homeworld**: The homeworld of the Zabrak is Tizan, though there are multiple Zabrak colonies, Zatera, Tanzat, and Bandor.

Not bad. I would like to see a bit more detail on them, just to flesh them out a bit (same with the Kel Dor), but I already like them more than the Lucas-verse Zabrak.

hmm, alright. This was something I threw together before I went to bed. i'll get on it after I get home from school.
oh, btw, I'm designing quite a few planets, including a base for the Reaping, and a world where all the major starships are built.
