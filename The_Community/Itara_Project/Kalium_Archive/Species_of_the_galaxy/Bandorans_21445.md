Bandorans
**Ability Modifiers**: +2 strength, -2 Intelligence. Bandorans are strong for their small size, but have less intelligence than some species.
**Small Size**: Bandorans gain a +1 size bonus to their Reflex Defense, and a +5 size bonus on stealth checks. Their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of medium creatures.
**Speed**: 4 squares
**Scent**: The blizzards and wind storms make visibility very poor, which is why Bandorans developed a strong sense of smell. Bandorans ignore concealment and cover for purposes of Perception checks, and take no penalty from poor visibility when tracking within 10 squares.
**Insulating Fur**: Bandorans gain a +5 species bonus to fortitude defense when resisting extreme cold.
**Rage**: Once per day, a Bandoran can fly into a rage as a swift action. While raging, the Bandoran temporarily gains a +2 rage bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls, but cannot use skills that require patience and concentration, such as mechanics stealth, or use the force. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the Bandorans Constitution modifier. At the end of its rage, the Bandoran moves -1 persistent step down the condition track, which lasts 10 minutes, during which the Bandoran canâ€™t engage in any strenuous activity.
**Automatic Languages**: Bandorean
**Personality**: Bandorans are generally calm, but when angered go into a furious rage. Bandorans that go offworld often become too attached to drinking.
**Physical Description**: The Bandorans are squat, hairy mammals with white fur, vaguely bearlike in appearance ((think somewhere between a Wookie and an Ewok, then cross it with a polar bear)). They have noticeable large muscles, larger than most would expect for a species of that size.
**Homeworld**: The homeworld of the Bandorans is Bandor.
Bandorans were originally a primitive species, but the arrival of Zabrak colonists changed all that. The Zabraks determination allowed them to successfully colonize Bandor, and then they met the Bandorans. After a few early skirmishes, the Zabraks and Bandorans made a truce, and the Bandorans were given some of the Zabraks technology. Ever since then, they have learned how to manufacture their own technology. Bandorans have also since traveled the galaxy, interacting with other species, though they have gained a reputation for raging in cantinaâ€™s after getting too drunk. Unfortunately, bartenders canâ€™t ban them from bars, otherwise theyâ€™d probably rage on them. Bandorans though generally try not to rage in bars with Zabrak bartenders though, as they feel a sort of debt to them.

I think they need more detail, but I like them.  They are incredibly strong for their size (that +2 strength while small is equal to a +4 if medium).  Nice break from the norm.
Not so cool about the scent thing.  I mean, in a blizzard you got fast & terrible winds, and snow, and such.  How can you smell anything in that, much less track anything?  Mind you, I like the rules of the scent, just not the reason behind it.
But hey, good job.
