**Personality:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

These creatures are curious and cunning, but also contemplative very preferring to meditate over matters and let things come to them than act on impulses. They had no concept of space or that other species existed as their would is shrouded by defense forested swamps, clouds and a strong van allen belt that disrupts communications beyond their planet.

**Description:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The race is still very much squid like though its learned to walk upright. Of its 6 legs, 4 are used to walk or catch branches and swing though the trees; the other 2 are used for handling tools, though all 6 can actually do the job as easily. In her worlds gravity only 2 were needed for walking but in normal gravity 4 must support the creature. Its lost most of its chameleonic properties, but still uses colour in its *speech* to display emotions and moods. The body of the creature is now more developed with big eyes for seeing in the water and a more developed brain area. In all though the creature is rather soft and squishy with no natural weapons. To compensate, they almost always carry symbiotic weaponry designed for that purpose. These devices that razor sharp needles at high velocity or fire capsules of acid, as well as as many other designs as their cunning intellects can dream up.

**Homeworld:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Talran.
It is a densely forested and swamp covered small planetiod with only 0.5G gravity and humid rich atmosphere. The swamps are tens of meters deep with the trees stretching from the swamp beds to the surface easily and stretching 30-40m further into the canopy. Tangles of branches form dwelling space for the canopy living creatures to live but the dominant species is a sentient form of squid that lurks in the water below creating organic homes and other rather simple technologies to aid them. even as far as organic based weapons to fend off predators that sometimes prey on the almost defenceless species. Recently though a few of their brighter kin have been studying the planet and trying to venture beyond the stars. Most think their crazy though as there's nothing beyond the clouds.
The planets forests, radiation belt and clouds have kept travelers away and prevented the swarmp dwellers from picking up any communications. Their technology is actually surprisingly advanced though they have little use for it in their everyday life. So far in fact that the "crazy ones" have managed to build space capable craft from their organic technology.

**Ability Modifiers:** -2 str, -2 con, +2 int
**Small** +1 to Reflex Defense, +5 to Stealth checks, Carrying capacity is 0.75
**Speed** 1 sq on land, 6 sq in water
**Expert swimmer** May choose to reroll any Swim check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse. In addition, this species can take 10 on swim checks even when distracted or threatened.
**Breathe Underwater** As amphibious creatures, Talreans cannot drown in water.
**Primitive** Talreans do not gain Weapon Proficiency (rifles, or heavy weapons) as starting feats at first level, even if their class normally grants them. They may gain Weapon Proficiency (pistols), however they can only use their native weapons as well as slugthrower weapons. Until they familiarize themselves with other pistol weapons they take a -5 penalty on attack rolls.
Also until this species familiarizes themselves with the technology they take a -5 penalty on Knowledge (Technology), Mechanics, Pilot and Use Computer checks.
**Conditional bonus feat:** If Swim is a trained skill, gain Skill focus (swim) as a bonus feat.
**Special Equipment:** Talreans suffers limitations outside their own natural environment. The protective suit helps regulate humidity and supports their body. While inside the suit a Talreans is considered a medium sized creature and can move the normal 6 sq speed while on land, but cannot swim.
**Protective Suit**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

HP +5, +1 Reflex Defense, +2 Fortitude Defense
Cost: 10000; Availability: Unique
The suit, even though it has arms does not have the capacity to make attacks or perform delicate procedures. The arms on the suit are mainly used for lifting objects. Instead a Talrean uses ports installed in the abdomen (up to 4) to perform tasks. It takes a swift action to extend their arms outside of the suit to perform tasks. The suit because of its organic and mechanical component forms a symbiotic link to the user, as such when the suit is harmed so is the user.

</details>

**Automatic Language** Talra; Body changes color when speaking to display emotions and moods
This is a work in progress.

<span style="font-size: 1.80em;">Weapons</span>
**Needler Symbiont**
**Size** small; **Cost** ???; **Damage** 2d8; **Stun damage** -; **Rate of Fire** single, autofire; **Weight** 1kg; **Type** Piercing; **Availability** Rare
The needler Symbiont fires spines at the target. They don't require energy packs; instead they use needle clips, which when depleted, take 2 full days to regrow their needles.
**Spitter Symbiont**
**Size** small; **Cost** ???; **Damage** special; **Stun damage** -; **Weight** 1.4kg; **Type** see description; **Availability** Rare
If the attack is successful the target is covered in acid. The acid makes an attack roll (1d20+5) against the target's Fortitude Defense. If the attack succeeds, the target takes 2d6 points of acid damage. If the attakc misses, the target takes half damage that round. This attack occurs again each round until the acid is washed off or treated (requiring DC 15 Treat Injury check and a medical kit).
The acid has been specially engineered to only affect organic material.
This weapon can only be fired on targets within 6 squares.
Note: I'm adding this here for right now since these are racial weapons and specific for this race.

No comments? I'm suprised.

Hmm, well, I like the species. I honestly wouldn't play as that species, only because of the special equipment. But in general, I like it.
One question about the needler, how many shots can it fire, and it can fire autofire?

I agree not my choice for a playable race, but a great "alien" race to put in any adventure.
