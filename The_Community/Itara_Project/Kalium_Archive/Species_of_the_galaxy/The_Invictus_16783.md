# The Invictus

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Invictus**</span>
The Invictus are a group of Homo sapiens that have been modified at the genetic level. They are five times stronger and two times faster than an average human being of their size and gender, the Invictus are immune to most poisons, and diseases.
Due to their physiology they have a more varied diet, as they can consume organic substances that are inedible to normal humans.
They pride themselves on being able to survive in harsh, hostile environments where ordinary humans would easily die. However, Invictus men and women are not indestructible, and most environments that are inhospitable to Homo sapiens are also inhospitable to members of Homo sapiens invictus. Interestingly enough, they are able to breathe chlorine gas for short periods of time, although long-term exposure (longer than 30 minutes) will cause permanent harm, just as if they were a normal human being.
Their distinctive bone blades are a natural outgrowth, and are fully developed by mid-puberty. They can be either perpendicular to a forearm or can lie on the forearm with tips pointed toward the elbow and are controlled by a voluntary muscle on each forearm. The bone blades are made of a bone-like substance, and can be used as a natural weapon. In personal combat the blades are perpendicular to the forearm to stab an opponent.
The Invictus lifespan is a maximum 150 years of age.
**Personality:** The Invictus pride themselves on their attractiveness, strength, cunning, and treachery. There are two things a Invictus holds dear:
1. Family
2. Themselves
Family always comes first and foremost to a Invictus. Their personal motives, wants, and desires come second. The pride is last. So in short, Invictus are selfish and if it doesnâ€™t benefit their family or themselves they generally wonâ€™t be found doing it.
**Reproduction:** To Invictus men and women, biological reproduction is the single most important event in their lives. They choose their mates with care, only reproducing with those who have genes that will strengthen the Pride and the Invictus Species as a whole.
To become married and reproduce, a Invictus must present his or her potential mate to the Prideâ€™s Matriarch, who will do a genetic scan and determine if the genes of the potential mate are strong. If approved, the couple becomes married in a private ceremony, involving only the two of them. The Male and Female exchange matching bracers which signify that they are one. In Invictus Society, women have full control of their reproductive options in that they choose the men, not the other way around.
It is normal for high-status, wealthy and powerful Invictus men (or women) to have many wives (or husband), and to have children with each, with some families as large as one male with ten or more wives and thirty or more children.
A side effect of this ancient tradition is the remarkable phenomenon known as **Genetic Reincarnation â€“** it is possible for an Invictus to be born with a genetic makeup identical to that of an ancestor. This is a more or less impossible occurrence in ordinary humans, but is not at all unheard of among the Invictus due to the extent of their genetic augmentations.
**Family organization:** Similar to a wolf pack, though the "pride" terminology is distinctly leonine, the organization of the Invictus Prides is dominated by an Alpha Male. The Alpha Male will usually listen to the advice of the other strong men in his Pride, along with the stronger females. He will also listen to the advice of the pride's Matriarch.
Alpha Male: Leader of a Pride. The strongest, smartest, quickest Invictus Male of a Pride. One who has learned to survive while all of his comrades have been removed, thus proving his worth and superiority.
Pride Matriarch: Strongest Female of the Pride. Not necessarily the wife of the prideâ€™s Alpha Male (can be grandmother, mother, sister, cousin, or even daughter.) One of the primary duties of the Pride Matriarch is to assure that the genes of a prospective mate (either male or female) are good ones, and that those genes will benefit the pride by reproduction.
An Invictus becomes an adult when he or she reaches reproductive age, which can be anywhere from 10-14 years, with an average of 11.8 years of age. When they become adults, they are expected to maintain their prideâ€™s superiority
New Prides can be formed if a strong male and at least one strong female break off from their pride. The stronger a Invictus Pride is, the better a chance it has of becoming more powerful and defeating its enemy prides.
Example Pride names: Jaguar, Sabra, Drago.
**Naming:** Invictus males and females have long full names, which include a short genealogy. Their names include their given name, their name/surname, mother's name, father's name, and the Pride Affiliation. (e.g. Tyr Rhydin out of Victoria by Barbarossa Rhydin of the Kodiak Pride) If questioned about who their father's father is (in the case that there is more than one Invictus with that particular name) they will respond with their father's name followed by their grandfather's name. (e.g. Barbarossa son of Temujin Rhydin of the Kodiak Pride) Invictus parents may also use normal, human names for their children if they so choose.
**Home World:** Since they were genetically created they donâ€™t have one.
**Languages:** Human Speak, read, write Basic. They often learn other languages as well, including obscure ones.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Species Traits**</span>
**Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, the Invictus have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** Invictus base speed is 8 squares.
**Bonus Feat:** Invictus gain one bonus feat at 1st level.
**Automatic Language:** Basic
**Bone Blades:** 1d4 dmg, Slashing or Piercing.
**Species Ability Adjustments:** +2 Str, -2 Wisdom, -2 Intelligence, +2 Fort Defense
((This is my first stab at creating a race so be gentle. The idea for this race was taken from the TV show Andromeda. Thought it would be an interesting addition to the Kalium Galaxy so I decided to translate them to life hehe))

I do see them as being a little overpowered. One idea would be to use the houses with the stats, if they where genetically bred they would be bred with the house tactics in mind. Kodiak +4 str -2wis, Jaguar +2dex -2con +2str these are only examples but I feel it would set them apart from each other. Same too with the feats they could be set to the house one is from.

well, they essentially get the best of what humans get, plus speed, and extreme strength, greater than a wookie or mantellian savrip
that and no species should ever get bonuses in all 3 physical stats.
it'd go with +2 str -2 cha -2 wis (coming from the mutations)
I'd give them a +2 bonus to fort defense, instead of the bonus skill.
they'd still get the bonus feat, but they'd be better balanced, good first try though

> The Invictus are a group of Homo sapiens that have been modified at the genetic level. They are five times stronger and two times faster than an average human being of their size and gender, the Invictus are immune to most poisons, and diseases.

The immunity is not represented in the stats. As it is, these guys are described like super men.

What caused this? Who would design a super human with this extra growth? And does it help them scratch *that* spot in the middle of your back?
> The Invictus pride themselves on their attractiveness, strength, cunning, and treachery&#8230;.So in short, Invictus are selfish and if it doesnâ€™t benefit their family or themselves they generally wonâ€™t be found doing it.

Love this. A species with a built in personality flaw. Make them flawed, and they become 'human'. Or at least reasonably realistic.

This part is cool, as well.
*"Clones? Phft! Who needs clones?* I *have grandchildern!"*
> Home World: Since they were genetically created they donâ€™t have one.

So...they didn't just take one? Do they travel in prides? Is there a place a lot of prides gather? Is it typical/required that a pride has a ship capable of transporting them? Or do Prides stay in one place?

...Rowan...come young padawan, let us discuss a concept called *game balance*... :
All in all, it's a cool race. I like the idea. But as, is, right now, it is way, way too powerful. Pick a role, and they would excel in it (not so much as diplomats, but let's face it, they have 9 points they don't have to sink into other stats. They would do just fine in that area). Close combat, they would party like rock stars (speed, strength, dexterity, natural weapon, and an extra feat?) Every other aspect they would do well in, as still be able to dish it out in combat better than anyone should. There literally is no reason to any other species if this one is available.
Yeah, so, we need to talk about this species' stats.
I would reduce them, but that strikes me as wrong with this race. Instead, I would make racial levels like in D&D 3.whatever. Say, four levels you have to take, and at the end of it, you are pretty nasty, yet on par with a normal race. Either have this available only for heroic Invictus, or make a separate class for NPC Invictus (don't say that all Invictus are heroic. That's just terrible).
Or, we could give them stats as humans, and put their starting age way, way low, to represent this is when they are balanced with normal characters. Say the average Invictus is 8th level by the time he reaches adult hood, and that's +4 attributes, plus at least two feats.
Like I said, awesome species, in concept. We need to do something to balance it.
> ((This is my first stab at creating a race so be gentle. The idea for this race was taken from the TV show Andromeda. Thought it would be an interesting addition to the Kalium Galaxy so I decided to translate them to life hehe))

As I said, very cool race you crafted. I tried to be gentle. Let's work on making this race cool, without overshadowing everyone else.

Wow, thanks for all the input guys! and I'm glad you like the species. I see now just how overpowered they are the way I have their stats. I've never been good with the number crunching but when its pointed out I get what your talking about.
To answer a few easy questions.
They don't have a homeworld to call their own. They basically settle down where ever they can find a suitable spot. They travel in their prides however their are those Invictus that are driven by money and will become bounty hunters.
The bone blades were a result of the genetic mutations to the race. Some believe it was a hidden trait that only presented itself years after their initial creation. They are there for the soul purpose of combat.
Thats all for now lol. Gotta get some coffee before I can possibly think of more.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-17 09:36:39)

Nice work Rowen, but as some others have said, I think it seems a little overpowered.
After reading it through, IÂ´d suggest a -2 to Wisdom, and possibly -2 Intelligence. Since I donÂ´t know the origin of the genetic muattions done to this race, I canÂ´t say if itÂ´s warranted or not. But of someone else intentionally mutated humans (as it would seem) in order to create some breed of "super human warriors", then they would likely want to limit the mental functions of those warriors, make them more obedient and less able of independent thought (except regarding military matters that needs it, but no real "deeper" thought).
A -2 Wisdom would represent a slightly weaker mind, and a slight disability to take a deeper and more philisophical approach to things.
A -2 Intelligence would represent some limits to capacity of reasoning and creativity. It would also offset the bonus skill trait.

### **Rowen** (2008-10-27 22:17:32)

Okay made some changes. I lowered their strength and gave them negatives to Wisdom and Intelligence. I gave a bonus to Fort Defense instead of the bonus skill. I think that should help out things a little. Let me know what you guys think.
If it sounds good to go Ill post it at the main site soon.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-27 23:10:32)

hmm.
well, first off, no species get odd modifiers (so probably change it to +2)
and what's the point of bone blades? or is the point that they don't provoke AoO's as oppsed to unarmed attacks?
other than that it's fine.

Out of shear curiosity why no odd numbers? (I just like to know why lol)
The bone blades were just a genetic malformation that happened, it wasn't planned. Besides it makes them unique and just a little more cool. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-27 23:34:21)

just not done (not to mention that +3 is much more valuable than +2, in terms of point buy differences of 14 to 15 starting scores)

---

### **Rowen** (2008-10-30 20:12:05)

Okay I fixed the last remaining stat so I think everything is good to go. If everyone approves the changes to the stats and the over all species Ill chalk it up to the main site. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
