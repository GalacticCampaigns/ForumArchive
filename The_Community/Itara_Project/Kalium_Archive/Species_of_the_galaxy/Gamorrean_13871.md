**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Personality Description</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Everyone knows that Gammorreans are tough, brutish, and violent creatures, always seeking the next brawl and battle. *Tough as a Gammorrean tick* is a common phrase heard throughout the galaxy, and the reputation is well earned. Simple more than stupid, Gammorreans take pride in their proficiency in combat, and often find employment to gather more scars.
They are also a proud species, each one knowing the oral history of their clan and family linage. Rivalry between clans is common, and tends to lead to bloodshed should two members of opposing clans meet. Personal pride often takes a back seat to organizational accomplishments. While the Gammorrean who best the nexu is honored, it is understood it was more important for the whole hunting party to track, bait, and trap the beast, thus bringing honor to the whole team. A Gammorrean who does his part, taking pride in his own contribution and the success of the group over his personal accomplishments.
Usually.
All important matters are settled between Gammorreans by fighting; inter-clan disputes, legal hearings, even courtship and marriage involve some kind of combat. Few, if any, of these battles result in death or even serious injury, provided, of course, that both participants are Gammorrean. Once less durable species are involved, the Gammorrean reputation for brutal violence is displayed. Needless to say, diplomats to Gammorr are a special breed.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Physical Description</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gammorrean average about 1.8 meters tall, with thick green skin covering powerful muscles. Close-set eyes over a thick, fanged filled snout, and small horn adorning their skull give them a distinct look.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Languages</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gammorr, a language of grunts, growl, and signs. Gammorreans have a difficult time speaking most other languages, including Basic. Effectively, they can understand any language they learn, but can only speak Gammorr. Most Gammorreans are literate (in Basic, as Gammorr has no written language) to a small degree, but complete illiteracy is not uncommon.

</details>

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Example Names</span>** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gammorrean names are usually two syllables long, with the first syllable representing the clan in which they are part of (the "In-" prefix, such as the name Inkur, indicates the Gammorrean is no longer recognized by his former tribe). The second is the personal part of the name. Parents often choose to name their children after heroes of their clan long since departed. These heroes are those Gammorreans who were so accomplished they were awarded a third syllable in their name. This honor is usually award posthumously.
**Male:** Gartogg, Jubnuk, Ortugg, Ugmush, Venorr, Warlug
**Female:**Bastar, Kunhuk, Monjugg, Tonorr, Vindra

</details>

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Traits</span>**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 to Wisdom. Gammorreans are strong and incredibly tough, but they are not agile of body or mind.
**Size:**Medium. As medium creatures, Gammorreans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** Gammorrean base speed is 6 squares
**Great Fortitude:** Gammorreans gain a +2 species bonus to their Fortitude Defense, accounting for their great physical resistance.
**Bonus Feat:** Gammorreans gain Improved Damage Threshold as a bonus feat.

Ta-dah. Gamorreans redone.
I dunno, though. I gave them a +2 constitution, took away Primitive, and added Toughness. Is that going too far? Are they too good now?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-07-24 14:13:41)

I think they might have gained too much. Now they are definitely on the + side with stats, as opposed to having a slight drawback before. Improved Damage Threshold is a **very** good feat to gains as a bonus feat, especially for warriors like Gammoreans. It needs serious drawbacks to balance it.
As it is now, Gammoreans are extremely hard-hit muscle-packs that takes some serious pounding to take down (+8 DT, +2 Fort, +2 Hp/level and +2 Str) with drawbacks that arenÂ´t really big. Int is probably useless to a lot of Gammoreans characters, and Dex donÂ´t have to be that big a deal.

> I think they might have gained too much. Now they are definitely on the + side with stats, as opposed to having a slight drawback before.

I saw it as a big draw back. Primitive sucked, a total -2 to their attributes, and could only speak Gammorrean. Bonuses? Improved Damage Threshold, Great Fortitude.
Though I agree Improved Damage Threshold is nice, but not as nice as, say, Rage, or the Ithorian Bellow ability.

Intelligence is huge, actually. That is a trained skill, right there. Sure, trained in Deception is that important to a Gammorrean warrior, but Acrobatics? Initiative?, Perception? Pilot? These are very nice skills a Gammorrean could pick up.
Dexterity loss means something; In Star Wars, ranged combat is available and effective for anyone, plus a lot of great skills use dex, as does you Reflex defense. And if you get hit, you will take damage. If your a melee fighter, it's really important, just to get up into melee. You gotta either cross a distance, hoping not to get hit (dex to defense and/or acrobatics), sneak up on the guy (dex to stealth), or use a mount (dex to Ride) or a vechile (dex to pilot) to get close.
Plus, a lot of good melee feats are based off dex (Acrobatic strike, Dual weapon tree, Improved Charge, Mobility/Running Attack, Rapid Strike, Whirlwind Attack), of Int (Improved Disarm, Melee Defense, Whirlwind). Range combat feats relate to dex, of course.
Now, Primitive I simply removed. I saw it as really dumb thing to have for a species that has been part of galactic society for thousands of years. The end result was a hero was better off made a Jedi at first level before heading into Soldier. Same hit points, same BAB, better selection of skills, and you don't lose lightsaber proficiency. This, was annoying.
Attributes: I gave a +2 Constitution to fit with the idea they were tough, and to balance out the attributes. Then I added Toughness.
Still...I agree with it being too much. I think I'm gonna yank Toughness, after I see what a few other folks think.

Perhaps not, but it is still a very powerful thing to give away for free.

Sure, Intelligence means a lot in Saga, and thatÂ´s something IÂ´m glad for. But if you think of what the Gammoreans are meant to be, and what a lot of people probably plays them as (tough, strong, not-so-clever warriors), a lot of skills, or simply a very intelligent character might not be as important.

Dex is as always one of the most important stats, but you can make a lot of warrior-type characters to wich a -2 Dex is really nothing. And the Gammorean archetype is just such a strong tough warrior.

If you want to play a warrior-type that uses those types of feats, then you will just spend a few more points in those stats. But again, thatÂ´s not my typical Gammorean.

This, was annoying.

Primitive might not be the best of things, but I still think it can be somewhat appropriate. Gammoreans are always seen holding melee weapons here and there, but rarely (any time in the movies??) are they seen using ranged weapons. The reasons for this can be many, but being a part of galactic society donÂ´t have to mean that you uses all the latest technology and things. Several other parts of their society can still be seen as quite primitive.

+ Con is quite appropriate for them, but as you can see in the summary of what all the bonuses they had gives them, it adds up to quite a lot.

But if you think of what the Gammoreans are meant to be, and what a lot of people probably plays them as (tough, strong, not-so-clever warriors), a lot of skills, or simply a very intelligent character might not be as important.

I dislike the phrase "what the (any species) are meant to be". Every species is suppose to be able to do every class. Exceptions exist (Yuzon Vong can't be Jedi, for example), but that's what they are- exceptions. Gamorreans will have Jedi, Nobles, Scondrels, Scouts, and Soldiers, just just all the other species, and should be able to preform just fine in that area. True, they won't excel in certain areas- wookies don't make great nobles, but if you label one as a war chief or battle shaman, it fits- but they can still do as they do.
Part of the issue about "how they were meant to be" is game balance. Right now, Gamorreans are crippled, because some one decided they were "NPC thug only". They are there to be shot at, and they are suppose to fall down when shot. Wookies are "Hero only" (PC/NPC doesn't matter) which is why they have better strength & constitution than a Gamorrean, better abilities, and a few extra nick-knacks, and unlike out pig faced friends, they can't speak *basic*, but can speak other languages. Gamorreans can only speak Gamorr. That's it.
> Dex is as always one of the most important stats, but you can make a lot of warrior-type characters to wich a -2 Dex is really nothing. And the Gammorean archetype is just such a strong tough warrior.

Again, archetype. However, stepping away from that, I have no issue in the creature having negatives. It makes sense for the creature. But if you hand out negatives, and want balance, you hand out positives. Bothans, Ewoks, Sullustan, Trandoshans, Twi'leks and Wookies have an even bonus to negatives layout. Cereans, Duros, Ithorians, Kel Dor, Mon Calamari, have a +2 bonus, while Gammorreans, Gugans, Quarren, and Rodians have a -2 total. That's not right. Start adding in the other abilities, and you start seeing clear lines on which species is suppose to be "cooler" than other species.
> If you want to play a warrior-type that uses those types of feats, then you will just spend a few more points in those stats. But again, thatÂ´s not my typical Gammorean.

There are 6 strength related feats, 10 dexterity relate, and 3 intelligence relate feats. It's not so much playing against the type, but trying make they type. There just aren't enough "big'n strong" feats out there. So, you spend a few extra points in those "off-attributes", get access to those other feats and...end up behind the other melee combatant in the group, who happens to be playing a Transdosan, or worse, a Kel Dor or a Wookie, and is better at what you're attempting. It is sad when a slender, gas mask wearing freak is a better melee warrior than a Gamorrean. But under the current rule set, they easily can be.

Well, one, we're not making the move universe here, so what the movies had doesn't mean as much. Two, blasters aren't the latest technology. They've been common since the Sith Wars, some 4,000 BBY. It makes no sense that even the dullest of species not figure out blaster deal lots more damage than a stick or sword, and that hitting some one 100 meters away means they can't hit you with their stick. Especially for a species that's suppose to be constant fighting.
> + Con is quite appropriate for them, but as you can see in the summary of what all the bonuses they had gives them, it adds up to quite a lot.

So what do you think? Keep the con, loose the Toughness? Kept the Toughness, lose the con? What seems the best and balanced for our Kalium Galaxy?

Removed the Bonus Feat: Toughness.
So, as it stands, they have a +2 strength and Constitution, -2 Dexterity and Intelligence, have Bonus Feat: Improved Damage Threshold, and +2 to Fortitude saves. I still don't like the Primitive traits, so it's still gone. How's it look?

### **master_Tru** (2008-07-29 06:10:18)

I would add at least a -2 to Cha it would not take away from the changes you have created, it would only make them less sociable. Or a -2 to wisdom which would give them a little less common sense. The wisdom would make more sense with how they are written up, and if would help offset the extra ability they have.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-07-29 12:44:56)

Hm. I'll think on it. I'm still gathering opinions and all that. I mean, I think it's fine, but I made it, so of course I think it's cool. I'll make changes as ideas com in.
Also, if anyone wants another base race altered, I am volunteering to do that as well. Or an idea for a new race they just don't have the time or inclination to write up themselves.

Took this suggestion, and added it.
To everyone who read this thread. I was a bit harsh with some of my points, and for that I apologise. I was- still am?- on a high horse, and kinda beat people up with said horse. I ain't about to be cured of it, but I'm trying to recognize some of it.
Anyway. Cleaned up and pretty now.
