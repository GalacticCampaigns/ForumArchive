**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Togruta</span>**
There are 172 distinct tribes of Togruta on Tinn, and there are a few offworld tribes, as well. Each tribe has its own distinct set of tattoos that every Togruta receives upon reaching adulthood. Togruta can use the tattoos to recognize the tribe one of them came from.
In addition to the identification possible with the tattoos, they also have a more practical purpose. Togruta use them to hide in the red and white turu-grass of their homeworld plains.
Togruta are named after their ancestors, often a grandparent who was significant to the tribe. Instead of surnames, Togruta take their tribeâ€™s name, to show allegiance to the tribe, and not to the family. So Ahsoka, of the Silver Waters tribe, would go by Ahsoka Silver Water, and Codi of the Tribe of the Crescent Sun goes by Codi Crescent Sun.
Togruta work well in groups, so its no surprise that the tribes have divided their government into a hierarchy of councils. The Togruta also highly value the wisdom of age, and the oldest members of their society sit on the highest councils, and the youngest â€” some still children â€” sit on the lowest council.
**Personality:** They are a very social people, and few ever leave the security of their tribe. They are an aggressive race, who have no compunctions about taking their anger out on others. They have a system of formalized duels to settle a dispute within a tribe, though no such system exists between the tribes. They are incredibly loyal to their tribes, and few would ever consider betraying them.
**Physical Description:** Togruta have red skin, striped with white tribal tattoos. Their oval-shaped heads are crowned by two montrals -- hollow, white horns striped with blue. The montrals point upwards, but from them three or four head-tails snake halfway down their bodies. They are tall, muscular beings, often measuring around two meters tall.
**Homeworld:** The once beautiful, wilderness world of Tinn, which was nearly destroyed during the first galactic war.
**Language:** Togruta speak and write Togruti.
**Example Names:** Ahsoka, Codi, Shaak
**Example Tribes:** Silver Waters tribe, the Dark Craters clan, Tribe of the Crescent Sun, Blood Mountains tribe
**Adventurers:** Togruta rarely ever adventure alone. They are social able, communal creatures, who prefer the comfort of other peopleâ€™s company. When they do adventure, it is almost always in groups. Most of them are scouts, having come from the primitive world where they struggle to survive. The Force is strong in the Togruta, and many become Force adepts.
**Togruta Species Traits** 
Togruta share the following species traits:
**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom

**Pack Hunter:** Togruta deal an extra two points of damage on melee attacks against any opponents they flank.

Sounds good to me. Their a rather interesting race. As for the stats they don't look overpowered or anything but Ill leave that up to those who are better than me.
