<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Valorns**</span>
The Valorns are a heavily built humanoid species hailing from the frigid Outer Rim world of Aesa. They have a physique closely resembling that of humans, but tend to average around 2 meters in length, and posses very muscular builds, along with a distinguishing growth of body hair.
Having learned to survive in the harsh tundra of Aesa, the Valorn have become cunning warriors and hunters, priding themselves in the field of battle. They live in clan-like societies, each clan living on their own, and in posession of one major settlement to which they can retreat from their outliying settlements when the harsher peroids of the year strikes. The clans are typically in peace with each other, although periods of conflict has existed. These periods almost completely ended though, when contact was made with beings from the outside world, and the clans had to unite as galactic corporations sought to invade in order to exploit the rich mineral deposits on Aesa, and also to force the physically outstanding Valorns into a life of slavery. They did not expect the ferocity with which the Valorns would fight back though, and eventually, they were completely repelled. Following this, more peaceful envoys started to arrive, and slowly the Valorns came into contact with the rest of the Galaxy.
The society of the Valorns is based around the clans, and the clans are centrally governed by a council of clan leaders, and other individuals that have been recognized as worthy by the Valorns. Even as contact with the outside Galaxy has increased, few Valorns leave their home, although an increasing number has sought to learn what adventures awaits them out there.
To outsiders, the Valorn civiliaztion may appear primitive and uncultured, but they are really neither. Although warriors still prides themselves by fighting in close combat as the utmost symbol of strength, they have adopted the technologies of ranged weapons into their culture. They also share a strict concern for their kin, and puts the clan in front of everything.
**Personality**: Valorns tend to be calm, bold and honorable. A ValornÂ´s word is his life.
**Physical Description**: Valorns have apperances similar to humans, but they stands in average 2 meters tall, and carries an average body weight of about 1,5 times that of a regular human. They also have a heavy growth of body hair, something that has made it very common among Valorn males to adopt heavy beards. Thanks to their excellent physiqes, they tend to have lifespans longer than the average human, sometimes as far as 200 years of age.
**Homeworld**: The arctic Outer Rim world of Aesa.
**Languages**: Valorn, Valorn Runes(Written Language)
**Example Names**: Pretty much human names, followed by a clan name. Clan names are typically in the form of descriptive attributes, describing the clans founder.
**Adventurers**: Valorns tend to be bold, and seeking to challenge themselves, typically as warriors. They typically seeks out challenges to prove themselves, as a rite of passage, or to prove themselves worthy of some honour or title. While these rites often takes place on Aesa, since the encounter with the outside Galaxy, many young warriors have sought to test themselves beyond the stars. As they may vary in kind, they often seek the tests of battle and honor, causing them to become hired bodyguards or mercenaries. Force Sensitive Valorn are uncommon, but those who can feel the Force are looked upon with respect by their kin. As long as they use it wisely of course.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Valorn Species Traits**</span>
Valorns shares the following species traits:
**Ability Modifiers**: +2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Dex, -2 Cha. Valorn are strong and enduring, but their accustomization to a harsh life in a harsh environment has caues them to become slightly stiff and gruff in manners and looks.
**Medium Size**: As Medium creatures, Valorn have no specuial bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Cold Resilient**: Valorn characters gains a +5 bonus to their Fortitude Defense against the effects of extreme cold.
**Unencumbered**: Valorn warriors prefers to fight unhindered by armor, and to rely on their own skill and ability to avoid harm. A Valorn character does not gain Armor Proficiency(Light) or Armor Proficiency(Medium) as a starting feat at 1st level, even if he would normally gain it from his class. He may choose it later on as normal though.
**Excellent Physique**: Valorn character gains Conditioning as a bonus feat as 1st level, provided they meet the prerequistites. Also, Endurance is always a class skill for Valorn.
**Conditional Bonus Feat**: From their harsh living on the tundras and mountains, Valorn characters have been taught how to survive in the wilds since childhood. A Valorn who takes Survival as a trained skill gains Skill Focus(Survival) as a bonus feat.
**Automatic Languages**: Basic, Valorn

No comments so far?

What is the Conditioning feat? I've never heard of it.
Also, no species has yet recieved two bonus feats. Maybe you could consider giving a special bonus that's unique to the species instead, since that seems to be the norm.

conditioning is in kotor book.
honestly, the bonus seems alright, the species isn't that great in general

If its in the KotOR book, that would explain why i've never heard of it, since I don't have it.

So far, the species is quite specialized. I had planned to give them a +2 to Strength, but I thought it may be too much, so I wanted to see what people thought about this first.
Another suggestion I had was to add Improved Damage Treshold as a starting feat for Valorn Soldiers. Thoughts?

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-15 13:34:51)

I don't think the +2 Strength would be overdoing it, but since I don't know what the COnditioning feat does, you can't take my word for it.
And, no, I wouldn't give them a third bonus feat. That would be overdoing it, no matter what Conditioning does.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-15 16:41:40)

The Conditioning feat allows you to reroll any Str- or Con-based skill check with skills you are trained in, and 1/encounter, you can add your Str modifier to your Fortitude Defense.
I think theyÂ´ll get a +2 Str, that seems very fitting actually.
The Imp Damage Treshold feat wasnÂ´t supposed to be a bonus feat, but instead since they donÂ´t gain Armor Proficiency as a starting feat when taking 1st level Soldier, theyÂ´d get (or get the option to take when multiclassing) that feat instead. But I think IÂ´ll drop that, or maybe a less powerful feat would be ok, like Toughness.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-15 17:50:00)

Conditioning isn't too bad, then.
I still wouldn't give them the Toughness feat, though. Primitive species don't get an extra feat to replace their lost WP feats, and this is sort of the same thing. If they decide to go the soldier route, I don't think they'd generally go the armor route anyway, so it's not a big loss. Giving it to them along with everything else is a bit too much, IMO.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-15 18:03:54)

Yeah, I thought so too. When I first spawned that idea, I didnÂ´t have them have +2 Str, and I didnÂ´t have them get Conditioning, but I think this works better. Will probably submit it soon.

I like this, sounds really cool. Again, Im not the greatest with the numbers but I have one question. I get the plus to cold environments, with them being from the outter rim and a artic world at that. But what about heat? I would think that they would be weak in Tropical (or hotter) climates due to the cold conditioning.
Other than that I think they sound pretty cool. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I can see your reasoning, but I donÂ´t think it is necessary. The resistance to cold isnÂ´t as much a physical resistance as it is mentally rooted. These guys have just learned to live with extreme cold, itÂ´s not something in their body that allows them to withstand the cold better.
