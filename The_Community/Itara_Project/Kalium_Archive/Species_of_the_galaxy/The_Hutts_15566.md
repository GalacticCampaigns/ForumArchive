**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Personality Description: </span>**As the self-appointed galactic police force, the Hutts believe that everyone's business is *their* business. They are megalomaniacs with holier-than-thou attitudes, though they rarely follow their own code of morals, believing they are above it. They do not take kindly to those who violate their code of honor, handing out strong punishments, which are often swift, painless, and result in the death of the accused. Their first loyalty is to their species, then themselves, then the rest of the galaxy.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Physical Description: </span>**Essentially giant slugs with short arms and wide mouths, Hutts have bulbous heads and eyes. They have rough skin which is most often blue and tan in color (though green, brown, and purple are also common). Generally, Hutts are corpulent beings, though some are considerably slimmer.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">History: </span>**Hutts first arrived in the Kalium Galaxy just over three centuries ago. Despite this, they have become ingrained in galactic society, thanks to their own efforts. As the children of a Jedi, the Hutts were all Force Sensitive.
They took it upon themselves to follow the Jedi Code, though it was soon corrupted by their own Hutt natures. They forced their "justice" on the people ofthe galaxy. This, of course, repeatly brought them into conflict with the Kalium Jedi. They survived their battles with the Jedi thanks to their sheer power in wielding the Force as a weapon.
Whether or not anyone liked it, the Hutts were there to stay.
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Example Names:</span>**Beldorian, Durga, Jabba
**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Traits</span>**
**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, -6 Dexterity, -2 Charisma
**Size:** Large. Hutts take a -1 size penalty to their Reflex Defense, a -5 size penalty on Stealth checks, and a +5 size bonus to their Damage Threshold. Their lifting and carrying limits are double those of Medium creatures.
**Speed:**3 squares
**Force Resistance:** +5 species bonus to their Will Defense against all mind-affecting Force Powers and Talents.
**Supreme Stability:** Hutts cannot be tripped or knocked prone.
**Bonus Feat:** All Hutts recieve the bonus feat: Force Sensitivity.
**Languages:** Huttese and Basic (or what passes for Basic in the Kalium Galaxy).

All hutts have force sensitivity......I'm quite unsure about that idea. that seems kind of the opposite of being resistent to force influences.
to me, it's too much of a stretch to make.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-08-30 04:50:36)

I would probably add in a penalty to charisma, seems to fit in fine for Hutts.

That's the part I liked most about them. Because they are Hutts, they are going to fall back into their crime lord roles if something significant doesn't change. Making them the Force Sensitive descendants of Beldorion did just that.

I originally had a Charisma penalty of -2, but changed it to reflect the stats in the core rulebook. I did so because Charisma is important to all Force-users, as the ability modifier for the Use the Force skill. Anyway, this had the added effect of increasing their Dexterity penalty.
So, what does everyone else think?

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-30 13:33:29)

I think they should get a penalty to cha, only because they gained force sensitivity. balance things out

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-30 13:45:58)

The Force Sensitivity feat replaced a skill bonus to Persuasion (a reroll, I think). Still, Force Sensitivity is more powerful and useful --so, would a -2 penalty to Charisma balance it out?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-30 13:53:07)

I think it'd would, mostly because the combo of force resistent but also automatically being force sensitive is quite powerful

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-08-30 15:34:29)

A - to charisma would also represent that while all hutts are Force-Sensitive, not all hutts are very strong in the Force.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-30 21:35:42)

Okay, I added it.

The idea of a species automatically attuned to the Force sit really wrong with me. The Force should require some kind of personal choice, I think, and not a genetic predisposition. I'm all for it being a popular choice, but not an automatic species trait.
Hutt warriors, accompanied by their â€˜law enforcementâ€™ personnel, enforcing the rules of either their religion or their government, that may or may not be Force poweredâ€¦thatâ€™s a cool image I am all for.
I dunno about the penalty to charisma. Hutts are suppose to be crime lords, or at least have a strong personality (hence, why they usually have a large number of followers or employees. I say give them a bonus to Charisma. How to offset it...I dunno.
Oh yeah, I, personally, would prefer a species not desended from some of Lucas-verse critters. Steal the idea, make it yer own.
Also, these Hutts are a lot more physically active than the Lucas verision. Perhaps make them a little slimmer, or some descriptors on how their muscles are layered under the fat, or perhaps say something like "the ancient hutts came from an unknown planet, where frequent famines forced them to develop huge fat stores".

The only problem I have with them not being all Force sensitive is the fact that they're Hutts. Without it, I think they'd all fall back on their criminal ways and then they'd be too similar to their Lucas Galaxy cousins. Also, I think the Force (as is exists in the Lucas-verse, anyway) *is* genetic predisposition. I don't know what's been decided for this galaxy, though.
> Hutt warriors, accompanied by their â€˜law enforcementâ€™ personnel, enforcing the rules of either their religion or their government, that may or may not be Force poweredâ€¦thatâ€™s a cool image I am all for.

Just because they have the feat doesn't mean they have to take any other Force talents, feats, or classes (or even train in Use the Force). Those Hutts would just be very weak in the Force. Technically, if there's any realism, that's how most of the Hutts would be -- weak in the Force with their stronger cousins in law enforcement.
Rules-wise, with only the Force Sensitivity feat, they can only use Use the Force to Search Their Feelings, Sense Surroundings, and use Telepathy (and the minimum DC for each is 15). Still pretty powerful, though.

SacredPhoenix, DarthAnthrax, and I agreed that the Charisma penalty offset their Force Sensitivity, so if we ended up deciding not all should be Force Sensitive (though I really like the idea), I'll remove the penalty. Besides, the Hutts *are* hideously ugly.
> Oh yeah, I, personally, would prefer a species not desended from some of Lucas-verse critters. Steal the idea, make it yer own.

Well, I don't know how we're doing things -- if most of the species are descended from them or not. I just did it because I needed to fill the history with *something*. I like the idea of them being related to the Lucas Hutts. You, apparently, do not.

I figured those who served as police would be slimmer, while all the rest sat around, doing whatever it is that Hutts do. As for the Hutt homeworld? I really had no idea what to do with it, or even if it was in this galaxy, so I didn't say anything about it. Any suggestions?

Not really. Only certain family lines of select species were "strong in the force" All others just kinda developed it.
All races can choose to master the force. Only a few do so, and those who do did so by a conscience choice.

Throughout the setting, most force users- and almost all super strong force users- were human, yet they did not start with Force Sensitivity. Maybe the Jedi class is a favorite among the Hutts (which is how it sounds). This way, you can have the differnece between heroic level and non heroics, and still not give the hutts a genetic predispostion to the Force.
Or perhaps give the an either/or conditional feat. "If the hutt has (whatever skill) or Force Sensitive as a Trained skill, then they receive Skill Focus in (whatever skill) or Use the Force. If they have both, they must choose one or the other, not both." Again, nifty, but not automatically giving the Force in spades to the hutts.

This is a powerful bonus, to say the least. I don't think you should use the word "only" to describe what they can do with that feat.

*Charisma is **not** appearance.* It's strength of personality and innate skill with said personality. Besides, are you telling me a normal barbel would find a normal ewok pleasing to the eye (I mean, other than a snack)? Different species measure beauty in different ways.

Well, on the other hand, there are a lot of races in which there has very rarely been heard about a Force Sensitive. Of course, this could just be a conscious choice, but it seems very genetical to me.

I think the reason most Force Users are human are simply that humans are more numerous than other species. Also, that they are more naturally curious and eager to learn more. As well as their lust for power (in the case of great Sith Lords).
IÂ´m not sure what you means by "If the hutt has (whatever skill) or Force Sensitive as a Trained skill", since Force Sensitive isnÂ´t a skill...so if you could explain that thought a bit more it would be nice.

It is powerful, but at a minimum DC of 15 and being untrained (and thus not able to take 10), it is far from always successful.

Charisma is not apperance, but it **is**, among other things, physical attractiveness.

No problem. Guess we just have to agree on Force Sensitivity (if that's even possible),first. If we can't, well, I'll give it another week before submitting it. So, if anyone else has any opinions, please post them before next Friday.

???
It seems I'm unfamiliar with them. What are they?

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-06 14:33:06)

Hut power armor I read about....some where. It adds everything normal power armor grants (defense boost, strength boost, etc), as well as increasing hutt mobility. They were also suppose to be relics of a passed age (thus of course, hideously powerful). I'd say some hutts or their crew made some for their boss. No need to go nuts with it and claim every hutt in power armor wears an artifact.
Again, how I see things.

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-06 15:21:38)

Whoa! Among other bonues, it increases their Speed by four squares and has an E-web blaster built in? Those things are, as BoP said, "hideously powerful."
Where can I get one? <!-- s:evil: -->![:icon_evil:](https://i.ibb.co/C5wQfzF6/icon-evil.gif)<!-- s:evil: -->
But, seriously, they might be overpowered. Maybe, though, the head of the Hutt police force owns one as a status symbol? If there was only one, it would be keep it out of the hands of every wannabe Sith Lord and come to be viewed like Darth Vader's armor -- a symbol known throughout the galaxy, inspiring fear upon everyone who sets their eyes on it. (Or hope, I suppose, if the Hutt happened to be on the light side, though that would take all the fun out it.)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-08 13:09:46)

So, is there anything major we missed?
And, on the issue of species Force Sensitivity, does anyone else have anything to say? I know that BreederofPuppets is against it, and I'm for it.
Any other opinions?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-08 12:04:35)

Okay, BoP, I was looking through *Threats of the Galaxy* the other day when I noticed something.
The Miraluka are supposed to be an entirely Force Sensitive species, but they weren't given Force Sensitivity as a bonus feat. Instead they were given Force Training as a conditional bonus feat if they had Use the Force as a trained skill. (Of course, the Felucians all have Force Sensitivity.)
Would that work better? It would make a player more likely to choose to be Force sensitive, but they wouldn't *have* to be.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-10-08 16:38:21)

You know, that does sit better with me. But it's yer call to yay or nay it. I'm just one voice here. I didn't jump up and scream when the Hutts were posted as they are now. I don't like the Force Sensitivity at start for flavor reasons, but its not like its over powering. I have a flavor issue, is all.
But like I said, while I like the conditional feat idea, I'm not above just keeping my mouth shut and let you make what is yours.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-08 17:40:32)

Personally, I like the idea of Force Sensitivity as a bonus feat better. I feel it strange that not all Miraluka has it, since some abilities that comes from the feat seems to be inherent in that species.
Having FS as a bonus feat represents a general ability to feel the Force, IMO. Getting FT as a bonus feat for training in UtF means that a species donÂ´t necessarily have more Force Users than other species, but that those who do exist are more powerful than the average. For our HuttÂ´s I have been thinking in terms of the former, and with a Cha penalty they would all have a degree of ability to feel the Force, but slightly lesser so than th average Force User.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-08 20:35:57)

I like it both ways, though I favor my original way more. At heart, I'm a negotiator, and I like to find ways to make the most people happy with a decision.
However, I do agree whole-heartedly with DarthAnthrax. So -- for the time being, anyway -- I think I'll leave it.
Thanks for all the input, though. And to know you'll go along with it, even if you don't agree, well, that's more than I can say for some people I know. Keep it up.
And thanks again.
