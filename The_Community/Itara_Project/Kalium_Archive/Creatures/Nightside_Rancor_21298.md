Nightside Rancors are terrifying creatures, and measure about twenty meters tall. Their nearly-black skin blends in perfectly to the dark rock of Tinn's nightside, where they abou make their home in the caverns and tunnels in its massive mountains.
These monsters haunt the dreams of the Togruta, child and adult alike. Many myths exist about them in Togruta culture, all of them terrifying. Even the Togruta adults fear them, and know better then to stay away from the nightside.
They are exceptionally territorial, and will fight to the death to defend their home. They've never been domesticated, and no Togruta is foolish enough to try.
