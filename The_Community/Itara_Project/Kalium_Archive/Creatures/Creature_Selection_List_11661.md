This will be a running post for creatures you would like added. When the time comes to add more creatures I would like a large repository for people to choose from.

Bantha. I was surprised that it wasn't in the core book the other day when I needed it. It's not in the *Threats of the Galaxy* creature section, either, which surprised me. I ended up using the stats for the ronto, since I needed them right then when I noticed that they didn't exist.
So, banthas would be nice.

**Different breeds** of Rancor.
Kraut dragons, including environments on how they live.
Giant space slugs.
Mynocks. With rules on why it sucks to have them on a ship.
We are still having bio-technology right? Whole nest of critters there.
Carinorious plants. Both the moving and non-moving kind.
Useful plants. Like trees that produce glowing fruit.
Beasts of burden.
Attack dogs, of many varieties.

don't we have 4 breeds of rancor already?
normal
dathomiri
tyrant
the aquatic one
I would say that mynocks almost always use the pack traits, though it's true that that doesn't do much damage either way
I really like the idea of man-eating plants
