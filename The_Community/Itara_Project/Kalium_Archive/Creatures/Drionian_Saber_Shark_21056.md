**Ambush**-A Drionian Saber Shark deals an extra 2d6 points of damage with its natural weapons against a flat-footed opponent.
**Drionian Lungs** A Drionian Saber Shark can only survive in an atmosphere like the one on Driona, and need special containers and exhibits to be transported and displayed on other worlds.
Drionian Saber Sharks are dangerous predators on Driona. They live in the humid rainforests of Driona and hunt many smaller creatures that live in the rainforest, and even hunt Kel Dor and other explorers if they leave themselves vulnerable to attack. Drionian Saber Sharks donâ€™t normally hunt in packs, but will band together to take on larger prey. While Drionian Saber Sharks arenâ€™t nearly the largest predators, they are certainly one of the most aggressive predators, attacking anything up to large size alone, and anything up to huge in a group of 3 or more. Drionian Saber Sharks look at first glance like corellian sand panthers, though on closer inspection you can see they have a much different head, looking more like a shark with horns. Drionian Saber Sharks are so named because of their shark like head and their massive horns, which can cut as well as any teeth the Drionian saber shark has.
