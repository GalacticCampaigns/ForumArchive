**Hawk Eyes** Drionian Fighter Hawks have developed incredibly sharp sight. They only take a -1 penalty to perception checks over every 10 squares as opposed to the normal -5.
**Drionian Lungs** A Drionian Fighter Hawk can only survive in an atmosphere like the one on Driona, and need special containers and exhibits to be transported and displayed on other worlds.
**Agile in the Air** A Drionian Fighter Hawk may make untrained pilot checks to dogfight and use any other dogfighting related ability, and may reroll any pilot checks made to any dogfight related ability, but must take the result of the reroll even if it's worse.
The Drionian Fighter Hawks are some of the largest known birds to date. Flying high in Drionaâ€™s atmosphere, they hunt anything they see, and have incredibly keen vision. Drionian Fighter hawks have been known to attack fighters and transports that enter the atmosphere and often are able to disable them. Drionian Fighter Hawks make massive nests in the mountains of Driona and rest there during the night. If one ever sees a Drionian Fighter hawk, the best to do is to deter it by shooting near it, and if it actually attacks is to fight it back hard. It is best not to allow it to out maneuver you, as it is very agile in the air, and is known to dogfight as well as a fighter.

Man, this bird could give an X-Wing a run for its money, and might very well come out on top.

Another awesome creation....but I think MoDaVader is right, it could come out on top.
