# Let's Get This Train Moving Again

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-03 13:21:03)

I think it's time we get this moving again. I got a few things I'm working on I'd like to get up.
So, who's still interested?

Me.
Actually, I'm still working on some stuff. Slowly. Very slowly. But I am still workign on the history, a few factions, and trying to get a Force system/broad scope thingie that will suit a large group (hard, considering the transitions the GFFA Force as go through, and that's what I'm using as a base).
But I'm still in.

Cool. Now where did the rest of this thread go? We added a bunch of posts yesterday . . .

Huh? What other posts? The only I made is the only one I know about. But, I made it, so it's the only important one, anyhow.

Okay, apparently there was a database error and the other posts are gone. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
On the bright side, I remember most of what was said. We're going to use the wiki (that covers a few posts right there). Also, we decided to put members in charge of different areas of Kalium (technology, civilization, and Force traditions so far) to be the Manager. Basically, this position is just to make sure formatting stays consistent, we don't have content overlap, and--most importantly--we end up with quality material without the Kalium moderator (me) having to look after all of it at once.
Managers
Technology, ships, weapons: Darth Anthrax
Races, planets, and governments: MoDaVader
Force Traditions: Avarna
If there's another area you want to oversee, go right ahead. We know there's going to be overlap, but I think we can work well enough together to handle it.
Was there anything I missed?
Oh yeah, since the vote was majority positive for the hyperspace/FTL thing we came up with for Kalium, that's what we're going with. Since it's a wiki, we can always change our minds later (or edit as we go along).
And Ava, you wanted some sorted info to work with, right? I have some of that in the pdf I started as well as a list of threads I thought were good enough to include but never did. I'll try to get them to you tomorrow (Tuesdays are too busy for me).

The wiki has been made and is ready for user content. If you need more categories then please let me know.
Right now I have the 5 categories linked as well as an addition category for history.
All users can submit content and edit their own articles. Once you have chosen your Kalium moderators I will create a new permission group where they will be able to edit the articles (or deleted them) as they see fit.
Also it would be a good idea to start establishing content templates. I will leave that up to Vader and the Kalium mods.

So... if any lurkers get the urge to create again they should register for the wiki and have at it?
also - this open season to spam the mods regarding their take on rules? >.>

Thraken,
My understanding is, that you first post it on the forums, and then when it's been accepted by the appropriate mod/manager, then it can be posted on the wiki.

The wiki is tied into the forum registry. You may have to reset your password but you won't have to go through another registration/activation process to submit your content. I should also mention that it's been set up so only registered users can submit content, so you must be logged in to the site. This prevents the average lurker/spammer from just posting to the site.
Everyone who is a member to the site may participate in submitting content but unless your content was first posted to the forum then the article will be deleted.
