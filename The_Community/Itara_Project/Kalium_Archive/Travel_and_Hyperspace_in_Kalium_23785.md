# Travel and Hyperspace in Kalium

### **Thraken** (2009-02-12 12:58:16)

Well. This comes from wanting firm things to be set in Kalium. I ramble a lot and this is very messy so I'll bold section headings and important discussion points.
**Travel&#8230; IN SPAAAAAAACE!**
Afaik one of the earliest and sticking points of Kalium was that Hyperspace technology is 'less common' and I believe it was from Rowen's first draft of the Kalium Timeline that the 'Hyper-rings' were mentioned. I guess in the current timeframe they're used to compensate for the uncommon or slow hyperdrives.
<strong>The Hyper-something!</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**A 'fixed position' hyperspace system may take many forms. It could be the star wars eu Hyperspace cannon, it could be a ring thing or gate that just fires you to a point in the galaxy, it might not even be hyperspace but a wormhole effect.
What suggestions do you have on timeframes? should a hyperdrive trip take days? weeks? months? Can it reach anywhere in the galaxy? is there a limited range?
There may only be one type of system or even multiple kinds in the galaxy. You decide. I'm not in a sci-fi fluff writing mood :P**

</details>

<strong>Hyperspace travel times</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Mechanics wise I believe we do need to work out a time frame, even if it's not used - it gives us a feel for how fast galactic travel is. The SWSE thing is just 1d6 days x multiplier. The RCR thing was a table of travel times between all regions.
Suggestion
An idea I came up with is a system between SE and RCR in complexity. We broadly divide up the Kalium galactic map and we say that travelling inside a region is 1d6xmultiplier days (and maybe get a bonus to astrogation check), to an adjacent region is 2d6 x multiplier days and for each additional region add another die and +5 to the DC.
For whatever the non onboard hyperspace system we decide upon we could just use a smaller time unit. For example counting in minutes or hours rather than in days. If we do this then we can write whatever fluff we want, but mechanically we need only stick a multiplier to a given hyperspace system. Thus the 'old' and never been refitted ones could have for example x15 multiplier and yet still be faster than any onboard hyperdrive. And modern ones with x1 are just obscenely fast.

**Access (suggestion)**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

These Hyperspace systems, if they are constructs by entire civilisations - I doubt they are just left for anyone to use... The usual legal rating should be a good guide for access
* Illegal - under criminal control. May be accessed by them only, or via shady deals etc.
* Military - Government control only. Either by some emergency measure or by totalitarian government.
* Restricted - Non official government business probably requires a lot of paperwork and a fee, but after all that you can probably get a pass.
* Licensed - Probably for the more advanced civs. Get a license and you can use it for a year or pay a toll each time you use it.
* None - This would encompass 'lost' hypersystems - probably the focus or part of an adventure. If a permanent operating presence is on board then it will likely become Illegal in status. (governments probably do not take kindly to just anyone playing with these things)[/list:u:3lqxquu5]

</details>

**Starship systems**
the real meat of the thing as everyone wants to get at making ships.
<strong>Hyperdrives</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Hyperdrives are less common" - that it afaik.
**Does this mean there groups with no hyperdrives whatsoever? Groups with only a few hyperdrive capable ships?
Does it mean that the better drives less available? I unno. Discuss damn you!**
Originally I just thought the bias was towards lower performance drives.
Proposed rules of mine - based on what I'd imagined things to be like previously.
[spoiler]
* For ANY drive modified to be faster, apply the 0.5 hyperdrive rules on the bottom right corner p40 SotG.
* No .75 hyperdrive as standard.
* 3 EP drives Military Colossal (frigate or cruiser) or larger only.
* 2 EP drives Restricted Colossal or Colossal (frigate) or larger only
* 1 EP Drives Licensed Gargantuan or larger only? note that large lifeboats apparently have x15 drives.
Starfighters
3 EP drives may be made into hyperspace rings
2 EP drives may be hyperspace sleds or hyperspace rings
Also - to further increase the rarity I think the base prices for hyperdrives may need to be increased - because Star Wars prices are relatively cheap…

</details>

[/spoiler]
<strong>Technology Variations</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

IMO messing with things like resistance to one damage type and not others would make the starship creation rules really hard to follow...
The exact level and legality of ship systems available should be dependant on individual governments/companies.
One idea from timeline thread was templates that ships built by X group would apply suitable bonuses and penalties to produced ships sounds good. This type of broadly reaching thing is easier to manage than individually picking apart systems.
A similar idea - the factions could have stated bonuses and penalties templates on systems when creating ships. Thus rather than each ship being strong in some areas and weak in others, it allows groups to build to their strengths.

</details>

**House rules?**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Large Lifeboat - as mentioned, this thing has a x15 drive. Should we allow this in Kalium? or should we restrict large lifeboats to the most advanced factions only? (there are small lifeboats after all)
**Hangar Bay - One I really want to push forward - Cost mod/5 hangar space. This works well, lets colossal (frigate) sized ships carry ships and lets the by all rights huge colossal (cruiser) ships carry a decent number of ships.**
A rather minor thought - Tractor beams and Heavy concussion missile are rather large EPwise. What do you think?

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-12 16:21:47)

I'll just throw in my idea for how the "Hyper-rings" should work.  You have these massive rings just floating around in space, so why not make them a space station?  This way, we can have people working on it to provide maintenance and access to the Ring.  Anyone who wants to use a Ring has to file a flight plan so that the crew on the station can program the Hyperdrive to bring you to the correct destination.  Someone with the right skills could slice into the command program and set their own destination, but that would be difficult (but incredibly useful for the less-than-legal types).
After the Ring has been powered-up, anyone crossing the Ring's threshold is propelled into hyperspace.  Now if a ship has its own hyperdrive, it could activate it at any time to force them out of hyperspace.  This, of course, would be dangerous and damaging to the ship, but if it could have its uses.  If it doesn't have a hyperdrive, or chooses not to use it, the energy field holding them in hyperspace will eventually dissipate, dropping them back into realspace.  The calculations made at the Ring ensure that this happens when they reach their destination, not before.
As for a timeframe, I like your suggestion.  When I made my map of the Kalium Galaxy, I put little squares on it.  I was thinking at the time that they could be used to help calculate hyperspace travel times, though I haven't thought of a way to use them yet that isn't overly complex or doesn't result in very high travel times.

So we use the same multipliers for ship systems as for the Rings, but a different time increment?  We would definitely have some obscenely fast hyperdrives, yes.  I'm not so sure if that's a good idea.

There are undoubtedly groups with no hyperdrive access.  There are probably some who use hyperdrives instead of Rings, so their hyperdrives are a bit better than the average (though still not better than the Rings).  I was going to say that .5 - x2 hyperdrives are for the Rings, and that x7 and above is for the ships, with only a few rare ones in between.
The rest of your starship rules may or may not work.  I'm really lousy at starship design, so I'll leave it to others with more talent in this area.

**The Drives**
My suggestion would be to have hyperdrives remain as usual, but like weÂ´ve said, much more scarce. There could also be various "external drives", like the boost rings from the GFFA. An idea would also be to let there be spontaneous wormholes, appearing at random in the Galaxy. Anyone entering such a wormhole is drawn into hyperspace, and also exits at random.
<strong>Travel Times</strong>
I personally never liked SAGAÂ´s system of there being 1d6 days travel no matter where you go. I say make up a chart like the RCR one, and let travel time be relative to where you are going. Split the Galaxy into sectors, and have travel between sectors be a function of which two sectors you are traveling between.
**Acess**
Let them be acessible by anyone with the money, unless regulated locally in some way, in which case turning to the black market would maybe help. Make them expensive and difficult to make, meaning that they will mostly be used by governments, military, large freighting companies and wealthy persons.
<strong>Changing rules etc</strong>
I think we should leave much of the starship creation rules as they are, possibly incorporating house rules as standards for well known problems, but otherwise mainly leave the rules alone. Now, creating new systems to be installed on ships, etc, thatÂ´s something that should be encouraged. However, I would hate to see people getting crazy and starting to make sure that every little company/faction has some bonus. If you want them to have certain traits among their ships, vary what you spend the shipÂ´s EPs on.

**Travel… IN SPAAAAAAACE!**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

This is what I have been going off of when I wrote the history idea:
The first hyper engines were expensive and bulky, limiting them to the largest of ships.Â  A system may only be able to support one, and relied heavily on it to transport massive amounts of goods for trade.Â  During times of war, the hyper ships (hyperspace capable space craft) would act as carriers, bringing a small fleet of smaller war vessels inside of it.Â  Preparation for a hyper jump could take days or weeks with these ancient craft.
The â€œmain galaxyâ€ created the Hyperspace Rings as a form of mass transit.Â  They rings were expensive to build, but when compared to a hyper ship, they were incredibly quick.Â  Each ship wishing to use the ring only hand to pay a small tax (think of it as a toll on a high way) and they were sent as far as the Ring could go.Â  One Ring could even jump a ship to another Ring, creating a chain of jumps, making long range travel possible easy.Â 
A system only needed one Ring with in sub-light range to support it.Â  If that Ring was damaged, you could still jump into the system (from other rings) but couldnâ€™t jump out.
True hyper ships were the product of the Sith Empire (formerly known as the Fraxia survivors).Â  These new engines were small and expecnsive, but nowhere as expensive as the old hyper engines.Â  This allowed the Sith War fleets to jump where they pleased, without need for the Rings.Â 
Here is a thought: Sith hyper engines function completely different than hyper engines.Â  (game mechanics are the same, but the fluff is different).Â  Sith engines could be wyrm hole generators, or phase devices, or even â€œwarp drivesâ€ with â€œdylithium crystalsâ€.
During â€˜modernâ€™ times of the Kalium Galaxy, you have all three types (and possibly more).Â  The main form of hyper space travel is still the Hyper Rings, as they allow cheap transportation to the masses.Â  A few old Hyper Ships still coast on the solar winds, allowing trade to those systems too far out of the way for a hyper Ring to be built, and the where no modern hyper ship travels.Â  And then there are those ships with the Sith Engines on board, jumping from point to point like ships do in the Lucas-verse.
As I see it, Old Hyper Ships would have a x15 to x20 rating (or more).Â  The hyper Rings would have a x10 to x5 rating depending on how recent the upgrades are, and the Sith ships would have x5 and less (off set by expense).
Should we use a different style, I see old hyper ships taking months, the Ring taking days, and the Sith ships taking hours.

</details>

**Technology Variations**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I suggest keeping everything the same as far as game mechanics are concerned.Â  This species uses rail guns while this organization uses lasers.Â  They both deal 5d10x2 damage, and all that.Â  The only changes I would make is ammo loads for solid projectile weapons, or a weapon that can change damage types (the Gulridian sonic system can deal normal damage or ion damage, depending on setting).

</details>

**House rules?**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I think we need to alter the weapons all around.Â  We had a nice long thread about Star Wars ship combat, but it got lost.Â  My personal opinion is that we should model it more like WWII air and naval combat, and less like modern warfare.Â  WWII, fighter could sink (or at least, threaten) capital ships.Â  Carriers were feared due to their air craft.Â  Air to air combat was settled with guns and not missiles.Â  To equate this, anti-ship missiles or bombs are required (inaccurate weapons with massive payloads and no super guidance systems).Â  Big guns, equating to the 11 inch cannons on battle ships, are needed to be used as artillery.Â  And so on.

</details>

But, these are merely my thoughts.

@MoDaVader's points
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Sounds like a plan, but I wonder about traffic. Your setup sounds like its a case by case thing (Restricted or above on my 'Access' chart). This is because if there is high traffic, or traffic that comes at all hours it doesn't seem feasible. The fix of course is to have 'scheduled' times and jump destinations - which would probably replace hyperspace trade routes.
So another thing to discuss - **how busy are hyper-rings?**
My idea with the time frames was just a simple method of using what saga gives us. I accept that hyperrings need not be insanely fast, so I suppose we could keep it just on the vanilla multiplier scale after all.
However, there are things to consider like consumables with that plan - smaller ships may not be able to use hyperdrives given the very large multipliers and long trip times. **Perhaps we need to nail down the hyperspace travel time first?**

</details>

@DarthAnthrax's points<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

External drives are already in for gargantuan/huge ships, but beyond colossal I think the feasibility or cost effectiveness of building such large strap on hyperspace structures is that high..
And I don't think random wormholes would contribute much to a space travel system - unless you want everyone to be perpetually lost in space.
On travel times - I may vandalise someone's map at some point >.>
anyone with money unless locally regulated - what does that mean? are they like vending machines with a coin slot? o_O
I think the idea was that these things are expensive and take awhile to build. It would just be silly to have 'new' hyperrings pop up every where all the time.
I didn't say that the rules should be changed. I was mentioning that if variations are wanted, there should set templates or rules to work within so that things aren't unbalanced.

</details>

@BreederofPuppets's points
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So range limited hyperrings. that's good. **Are they controlled by some single neutral group only for the hyperrings or by local powers?**
Again I think we need to work out travel times, as with those multipliers it could make for a very slow galaxy...
WWII style
My personal opinion is that we already have that with Saga rules...
With hardpoints even Huge sized fighters can carry 9d10x5 missiles, The statted ships can carry fighter squadrons (though as I say, starship creation hangars need house ruling to do the same), Star wars fighter vs fighter IS mostly laser cannons on each other and the province of capital ships are pretty much turbolasers - which being x5 damage dealers and longest ranged weapons - are already the artillery...
In fact trying to be modern (as I've attempted with the rules) Is really quite impossible. 20EP heavy launchers mean that only a few can be mounted on smaller cruiser sized ships, and with frigate sized ships it leaves room for not much else. Point defense missiles are pointless as point defense flatly restricts range to the same as other point defense weapons.
I'm also not in favour of broadly homogenising the galaxy to a single method of fighting ^_^; seems kinda boring

There are things I really like here and other things I'm concerned with so I'll throw in what I have.
Starting with the assumption that hyperdrives in Kalium require larger field or power systems than in GFFA this changes the dynamic and takes us to places also not in GFFA. Small couriers would be hypers with engines if existing at all. larger ships could move better than smaller because of the power needs to run the larger hyperdrives. Fighters likely wouldn't have them at all and require carrier support or would need sleds to take them and would then become dependant on them lest it become a suicide mission. This would quite remove the space denial that the Rebellion, and indeed the entire line of thinking involving would rely upon: fighters jump from their carrier, keeping it safe and elswhere since the Imperial navy had much more resourse than a rag-tag rebellion that needed to scrounge for everything. This, by itself, isn't neccesarily a bad thing simply different and that is what Kalium is supposed to be: Different. This does introduce an entirely different element to strategies between factions and galactic geography (Hyperlanes) and something unique to Kalium since, IIRC there is *nothing* like that in GFFA.
Just to draw a parallel, of sorts, in the Honorverse (named after Honor Harrington lead character etc) there are places in a starsystem where space-time allows for FTL. Some are detectable and can be entered, some are only detectible when something/one comes out of it. For those of you familiar with Star Trek Voyager: "Suprise you've got a transwarp corridor in your backyard and your most feared and dangerous enemy is stopping by for a visit." As far as I can recall this is the only FTL available and they become defensive bottlenecks with huge resources devoted to their defense (logically). The FTL in the case of Honorverse was IIRC nearly instantaneous, it's been a while since I've read them. Recomended reading.
I can see the need for external nudges for smaller ships that seek size savings for other things so this means devices in orbit. Are they slighshots or are they, like Stargates, needing a receiver? What about interference en-route? In GFFA there are artifical gravity well projectors. Is this a technology that will exist in Kalium? If they are dialed into each other then I'd see the transit something not likely interfered with. If they are doorways into a realm then the ship better have a way back in if they can fall out of it.
The idea of Sith enhanced FTL drives has a certain apeal. The Siths channel force lightning resulting in a speed boost. Also the idea of people capturing/enslaving Sith to force them into enhacing their drives... or being simply physically grafted into the drive system... interesting that. "Resistance is futile? Heck know the more you ressist the faster we go! Ressist away! It saves you from the cattle-prod anyway. Ha!"

Depends on the sector, I figure.
Okay, to elaborate on that. Billions of ships and whatnot are being slung around the galaxy daily (or hourly). Add in the multitude of objects in space, and you have a good chance of two objects crossing paths. My fix for this is to have all the Rings connected by some near instantaneous form of communication. This will allow the plotting of routes and timing "jumps" so ships won't cross at the same time. The variable in jump times (1d6 hours here, 3d6 days there) are to represent traffic.

This would add up to a huge amount of credit very quickly. A lot of this credit would be used to buy supplies, pay the workers, and such, but the left over cash would make the Ring controllers economic powerhouses. And that's before we start considering the power of *allowing* trade to happen.

I'm tired, so this isn't making as much sense to me as I think it should. Coud you elaborate? Am I forcing a single method of fighting? Cause if you think that WWII naval combat is uninteresting, than I have to rethink what I am shooting for. Perhaps what I find interesting isn't as cool as I thought.
Again, only my thoughts.

Aye, the creators of Saga edition had to account for the masses of EU media where missiles and torpedoes are used in fighter vs. fighter. They can't really invalidate all that for you.

They're the really huge guns on capital ships...
iirc Ship to ship naval combat back then involves hitting the other ship, not firing some kind of miniature nuclear device that detonates on proximity that takes out several ships via area damage....
When used in orbital bombardment - that does do area damage...
afaik the only types of weapons that rely on area damage in vehicle vs. vehicle are flak guns for fighters and maybe depth charges.
What's your take on the autofire rules? because on top of the -20 for <colossal and the -5 proximity fire the result must be above 10 to even quality as a working autofire attack..

I'm tired, so this isn't making as much sense to me as I think it should. Coud you elaborate? Am I forcing a single method of fighting? Cause if you think that WWII naval combat is uninteresting, than I have to rethink what I am shooting for. Perhaps what I find interesting isn't as cool as I thought.
Again, only my thoughts.Well. You've only mentioned this, so it implies that this is how it should be Kalium. Am I incorrect?
Some people might like ion cannons, some people might like missiles only, some might not do starfighters at all, some might not have capital ships at all.
heck, a lot people probably don't have major fighting capital ships considering the many scattered worlds in Kalium. Basically it's a whole galaxy out there. Why are would every single one of them be slugging at each other WWII style?

Ya know, talking about how I would like to see star ship combat distracts from the purpose of this thread. I'll save my ideas on that for another thread. I apologize for the derail.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-04 15:16:07)

I have been reading a few Sci-fi books lately, and they brought up a few interesting thoughts/ideas/thingies. I figured I would share them with yawl, and see if they have a place in Kalium.
Space- Space is big. Like, really big. Really, really, *really* big. Millions if not billions or trillions of planets, systems, etc. With massive amounts of empty between each one. I mean, if you put all the matter in the galaxy in one lump and sat it in the middle of all that space, it would be like dropping a grain of sand in the ocean. There is a whole lot of empty out there.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, here is the problem: how are you suppose to control that much space? If your a group who wants to meet in private, you pick a random set of coordinates, and jump there. It's not like anyone has a chance of just bumping into you, out there. Planning you next coup attempt? Meet me half way between the Black system and the Quan system. Need to build a giant planet killing moon? Just warp out to Fraxia system, turn left at the moon, and head out for three days; they're already built one out there, and most of the equipments is still there.
My suggestions? Limit hyperspace travel. The Rings can do most of this nicely, but not completely (which is kinda what we want, I think). It gives entrance and exit points, establishing control. You can monitor, to a degree, what goes where, and this allows a government to have control.
Which then makes the Lucas-verse irritating, but that's another tale.

</details>

Communications- honestly, this is huge power, when considering the size of the galaxy. Star Wars never really touched on it. At most, all they said was that the Empire set up the holo-net, and that allowed for near real time communications. Various methods might be used, and here is a short list of what I came up with:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hyper Rings- the Rings have some sort of relay that allows near real time communication, but only to another Ring. This increase the importance of the Rings, and give the main galaxy an up on the Sith or anyone not paying the Rings for the privleage.
Ship Board Storage- in the simple form, every ship is required to have a data storage area to carry mail back and forth. Before you leave port, mail is loaded into the storage area, to be broadcast out as soon as you reach your destination. The mail is not accessible to the crew, and stiff fines/jail time is promised to anyone who does (not to say it doesn't happen).
Mail ships- as above, but dedicated mail runners.
Hyper tubes- like a mail ship, but in truth just a hyper space capable message capsule. Expensive, because it's a rocket that can jump into hyper space, but it's better than no communication at all. Plus, it's one way.
I'm sure yawl can think of other ways to communicate. Hell, we can even have a group of Force Users forming a business of sending messages back and forth using a specialized form of telepathy.

</details>

One thing to keep in mind about communications: *battles are won and lost by the lack of communication more often than the lack of weapons*. You need commo before you needs guns. A weapon pointing the wrong way is as good as a weapon not there.
Anyhow, there they are. Talk to yawl later

Honestly, I never liked the idea of needing two Rings for travel. It limits travel too much, imo. With only one (needed to enter hyperspace) you still get control, because someone has to program in your destination (it still allows slicers to put in their own). It would be possible to arrange meetings in the middle of nowhere, but someone who wanted to find it could still do it.

I really like this idea. Connecting the Holonet to the Rings simplifies things a lot. Holonet access for a faction would be the same as its access to the Rings.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-27 15:32:32)

I have been thinking, again.
Hyper space travel and the Kalium Galaxy. Do we really want the Hyper Rings? I hate asking because I first posted the idea, and I was the first one to push hard for it, but I've been wondering about it, of late.
Trade will happen between one system and the next, because we will have FTL. Hyper Rings create stable, permanent "roads". Direct, fast travel. Only, on these roads, their won't be any chance of bandits. You climb in the ring, gt shot to another ring that shoots you to another ring, that shoots you to another, etc, until you reach the destination. So, it's safe. And therefore, boring.
FTL journeys will naturally be a bit boring, when you enter hyperspace (unless we devise how one can attack another in hyperspace). In the Star Wars game, it's a lot like the Hyper Rings: fly until you reach a certain point, hit a button, and your safe until you reach the end point. Next to no worries between here and there. Just how, exactly, are pirate suppose to raid your ship, if everyone can escape within two minutes of detection?
Now, if the hyperspace routes were shorter, due to say, shifting gravity bodies or magnetic flux or flying cows, then things would be a little more interesting. A ship could only jump so far, until it reached a certain point (like a beacon). There, is would shift into real space, putter along for a while, until it reached another point, and jumped to another beacon. Or, upon reaching a beacon, it could jump in a different direction, and go around obstacles.
Then again, we could have three or four different FTL systems (I think we talked about this before), and...something. I'm up passed my bed time, so I forgot what came after the 'and'.
Anyhow, Hyper Rings. Anyone seen "Finding Nemo"? Remember the Trans-Atlantic Current? It was a constantly flowing stream that was really fast. We could have the Hyper Ring be that. Anyone could enter, easy like, but exiting would take some skill (hence the astrogation roll) especially if you wanted to get out at your correct off ramp. Plus, since it's not- technically- hyperspace, you could have ship battles, boarding, etc, while in transit.
With the 'Current' idea, one would not be shot exactly where you needed to go. You would ride the current until you got close, get off, and then jump under your own power until you reached your destination. This would create trade routes, require some ships to have their own FTL, and leave plenty of run for any bandit warlords.
Thoughts?

### **Thraken** (2009-03-27 16:40:19)

my personal opinion is that I hate the jumpgate idea. It's in almost EVERY BLOODY SPACE SIM GAME I have heard of.
that said - if it's a network, then entry, exit and nexus points are pirate bait. In Freelancer the in system gates were a network that required regular gates that could be disrupted to attack the travellers.
You could always use gravity wells. Stick a gravity well on a route and you could create big problems for a traveller suddenly stuck in the middle of nowhere.
In the Star Wars Universe - and maybe the RCR rules, hyper travel for the majority are composed of short trips with many stops in the middle of nowhere or at ports. There ye go.
Four different FTL. Please refer to the wiki for the game Sword of the Stars.
Finding Nemo - I do believe that's called the gulfstream. and that would be the hyperspace cannon idea - where you fired in a direction and the pilot or ship has to do something to make the correct stop.
My opinion is vague, but I thought the combination of FTL drive plus travel network was good - Kinda like in Mass Effect.

### **Rebaav** (2009-03-28 09:19:29)

I like the idea of the rings providing or simply marking a stream effect. The points between "rings" or markers would have a gravitic tension leaving it clearer and easier to navigate hence faster travel. As was already mentioned this is cannon, in SW, it just goes by a different name or isn't actually mentioned. This would also allow for pirating and a liner industry and would also have the ability of stepping back into the stream.
A "dialing" build would not allow for pirating or liners as anyone would have access and nothing could pull ships out of a dialed path. This was already mentioned by myself and others before.
In GFFA (cannon SW) I was always wondering why hyper capable droid cruise missles capable of mass destruction, or at least anti heavy naval, aren't commonplace. They would be much cheaper than fighters with their life support and pilots etc etc. Droids, including droid fighters, have already been shown to be dirt cheap shown by their ease of mass production.
In Kalium with hypers, it seems, to be far more expensive and larger (I LIKE btw!), I'm glad to see this won't be an option... Unless there were dialable gates. Carriers filled to the brim with hundreds of cruise missles that are then dropped into a hyper ring or into hyperspace from their own drives... brr. Even if they simply deploy mines instead of homing into a target, upon arrival, the tactical and strategic implications are ... interesting. Having to have those on an actual, and likely crewed, ship introduces balance I'm more comfortable with.
I'm only one voice among many this is simply my opinion with what little weight it carries.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-28 20:04:29)

Yah know, I am really starting to like the gulf stream idea. Something like...there are naturally occurring 'lanes' where hyper space travel is just a little faster, and the factions built hyper rings in those lanes, speeding up the streams. A ship merely flies to the stream, enters, and rides the current until they wish to get off.
The current would be one way, and the 'stream would have to loop back from time to time, and it could even run back next to itself, but it would make an easy to understand, easy to use (hard to master) FTL. Plus, with it's limited coverage area (it won't go to any where near all the systems), you would have established trade routes and great reasons to have alternate FTL systems.
Sword of the Stars...interesting. Node lines, star gates, stutter warp, and hyper space and rip drives. I'll work with these.
Okay, I'll kick some more ideas around. Thanks for everyone who commented, and any who will comment in the future. No worries; I'll listen to later ideas as well.

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-29 00:20:10)

I'm not too partial to one method over the other, but this to say:
JUST CHOOSE ONE ALREADY!
If we keep changing tactics every time we start to make progress with one idea, we'll never get anywhere. If we switched every time someone mentioned a cool idea, we'll lose all the progress we made with the last. We were finally getting somewhere with the Hyper Gate idea and now you want to go with the Space Currents one. >:(
I like the Currents idea. I really do, but come on, shouldn't we just choose one idea and go with that? There's always going to be a cooler way to do this idea or that one, but there are cool things you can do with the Gate idea that you can't do with the others.
As I said, I'm not particularly partial to one idea over the other, but we do need to decide on one (or multiple ones).

well. seriously now. Yeah. Nothing's gonna happen till we get this basic of a GALACTIC SCALE setting down. Which is why the first post has my name on it.
Personally I still want the ability for relatively small ships - say Colossal (Frigate) to have a drive that lets them go in any direction, even if it's not far or fast. *I want to be free!*

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-04-08 12:06:08)

Alright, you damn decisive people. Fine, fine, fine.
Okay, until told otherwise, I will operate off the following:
*Hyper Rings* are the main form of transportation, and have created long â€œhighwaysâ€ in which ships may travel. The Hyper Rings touch a small percentage of the known systems, forcing alternate methods to be used to reach these back routeâ€™ worlds. Hyper Rings are also the carrirs of near instantous communication across the galaxy.
Also, there are breaks (gravity shadows, still exploding novas, etc) in the Hyper Rings hughways that force ships to go 'off road' for short disatnces, dropping into sub-light speeds to get around this road blocks. In general, these are GM plots ready to be dropped whenever nessisary, and glossed over when not needed. They extend the trip a bit, and make it possible to have space stations/trading posts out in the middle of nowhere.
There will be jump drives that other ships can be used. Small transports can fit at least one type (multiple types will exist, each with only the minimal amount of rules necessary, which can mean no rule change, and just fluff).
There will be a type of FTL that can fit into Starfighters. The price will (should?) be hideously high, preventing large governments from buying them in bulk, but small enterprising groups of do-gooders could get them by hook or crook.
This is pretty much we already decided. Sound good?

I'm confused by this because I thought that hyperspace was already just like this without the Rings. The instant comm is with those holo thingies as presented in Clone Wars and the movies. Was it discussed if the holonet was or was not part of Kalium? If it is the hyper rings provide an odd redundancy.

I was under the impression that the drives for fighters were crazy big not just expensive.

The difference between them, I thought, was that regular hyperdrives were slower and unreliable. The Rings are used simply because they are neither slow nor unreliable. We started discussing the Holonet somewhere . . . I think the Holonet was simply tied into the use of the Rings -- the Rings doubled as a Holonet transmitter.

Yeah, me too. I thought the hyperdrives were simply to large to use on anything but a heavy fighter, and that fighters required carriers to transport them everywhere.

(gonna cry)
As I see it, Hyper Rings are stable, and cheap, and fair quick (there is quicker, but they are no where near as cheap). I added the 'off road' parts to allow adventures. But that part is easily removed.
I think we should allow other FTL's so diversify the galaxy, as well as allow the Players to have better than what everyone else has. And while I hate fighters with hyper drives, this is Star Wars, and thought yawl wanted to keep the idea. Now it looks like yawl don't, or don't mind.
And yes, I strongly agree that at least light transports should have their own hyperdrives. These would be much more stable than the orginal hyperships (well, duh), but not so stable as the Rings.
Is this closer to what yawl expect? If not, do tell me.
Speaking of which, what about a FTL that relies on a force power? Get enough of a crystal, or enogh of a certain tradiation, and tehy can jump a prepared ship to any portion of space they have been to before. Give them some kind of cool fluff bonus (no time passes for the passengers, or the ride NEVER suffers from failures, and restrict it by limiting where the force users have personally been, or by exhaustion, or something. What do yawl think?

Well, it's an interesting idea. If we can find a good way to make it work, I don't see why not. We'd have to be careful not to make it too overpowering or everyone would enslave Force-users to run their ships. (Though, that might be an interesting idea for some faction . . .)

I was actually thinking of a merchant family that discover little baby Alma didn't need an astrogation computer or a hyper drive to go back home and get the toy she left. She did need the space ship though. What happened after that was trade and profit (and family).
But slaving them sounds interesting...

I think that having something to make Kalium stand apart from GFFA would be nice. Fighters not being able to be combat effective while still having FTLs is one idea. Another is this force enhanced FTL. We should get a thread going for votes for differences and one for similarities.

I didn't think we were having FTLs on fighters - but if you think about it. standard rules 4-6EP for an internal hyperdrive as nonstandard - you're not gonna fit a whole lot else on em anyway.
Hypersleds and Hyperrings however....

This reinforces the point then, and please correct me if I'm misinterpreting, that the stock builds are flawed then. Almost every rebel fighter has an FTL and armed beyond all reason. Freaking y-wing has a turret for fraks sake.

I've always wondered why with hypers so common with Star Wars GFFA why we didn't see hyper equipped cruise missles all the time.

eh. could be all sorts of excuses - they're too expensive/take too long to build/too environmentally unfriendly to blow up for every shot. Or defenses just shoot down unmanned missiles too easily.

Sorry, "HAX"? Cost-wise, I agree, drones being used to deliver ordinance is much more cost effective.

Regular missles don't have a problem being a viable weapon in SW:GFFA and to the previously mentioned points, please reference something called The Galacitic Empire <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Thraken** (2009-04-10 08:46:25)

some notes
**Gate and Hyper**
I had already posted a possible Kalium changes elsewhere over in the starship submission thread. I'll put some updated ones here.
> 3 EP drives are colossal (frigate) larger or hyper-ring only (the jedi fighter type ring, not spacegate). And are military grade. Maybe also add that x1 drives are Battlecruiser size only, and x1.5 cruiser size or above only.
> 2 EP drives are colossal, larger or hypersleds only and are restricted.
> Multipliers less than 1 should be used to describe the travel times of the hypergates or whatever you people want to call them.
> The base cost for drives should be multiplied a few times to account for the increased difficulty in production

There was resistance to my idea of doing this before, but my reasoning for using the EP classifications is to leave the underlying mechanics untouched as much a possible rather than changing everything in that table or creating a whole new set of stuff from scratch.
To compensate for travel times, the base unit of travel time should be increased dramatically.
**Force and Hyper**
I can only imagine this using the UtF skill to a large degree in some way. Maybe you could also make a Force Navigator Talent Tree if you really want force related hypertravel - which is also an Infinite Empire thing actually...

Crunching. Details (to be approved or disapproved) to follow. Basics, I believe are the following:
**Hyper Gates:** Cover the main routes. Cheap (minor toll at gate, based on destination). No special equipment required. Decent speed (like x2 to x5) depending on quality of route (well traveled routes mean lots of money collected via tolls means more money on upgrades).
**Hyper Ships:** Mostly ancient vessels. Old (measured in thousands of years) but for out of the way systems, this may be the only way to get routine access to out of the system. Slow (x5 *at the most*, and there better be a good reason for it). Huge device (like colossal [cruiser] or colossal [frigate] minimum, I think, and takes up 10 EP). Expensive to build & maintain.
**Warp Drives:** Smaller that the hyper drive engines on a hyper ship. Warp drives use that very scary tech that creates a wyrm hole in two different places (entry and exit points), and slips through them. This should be made as scary as possible, but quick. I would say every check to enter warp is like one without navigation data (DC 30). Neat part? It fits on everything from heavy fighter on up (instead of hyper sleds, perhaps use warp sleds).
Side note: Warp drives can be- perhaps should be- merely reworked to be the newest generation of hyperdrives.
**Force Hypers**: I'm still working out the details, but I think to use the Force to jump, you need a feat (Use the Force and Navigation skills are perquisites) and should be tied to a tradition. [Pyslans](http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=21189 "http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=21189"), perhaps? Make it pleasant, but *reeeeeeally* expensive. I'm in favor of having the crew and passengers not experience any time going by (time outside the warp goes on as usual).

Are one or two gates required for travel? Your version sounds more like the two gate idea and thats fine if thats what we want to go with. I just want to know.
Also, are we going with the idea that Hyper Gates can be sliced into, to change destinations and otherwise get around the toll? It should be fiendishly difficult (no DC less than 25, some should be higher), but i think it would be fun. You could have all sorts of shady characters trying to make use of the gates illegally. Besides, the Rings would have to use computers to plot the jump (even to another Ring) and that means slicing is possible in some way.
Lastly, are we connecting the Holonet through the Rings? If so, only major systems (or, maybe, those close by) would have access to it. If we have a separate Holonet system, it's completely different.

I don't know about *thousands* of years, but that sounds about right. even in Star Wars, I don't think a thousand-year-old starship would be spaceworthy. Though, the idea does sound cool.

I like the second idea better. if hyperdrives are all old, why not let warp drives be new? They can still be dangerous (they could be state-of-the-art but not well tested, or all prototypes). Maybe a 10% chance of failing with every use and dropping you off in the middle of nowhere with no way back. Of course, falling out of hyperspace and starving to death because the closest system is forty light years away isn't particularly cool.

How about a talent instead? If we're attaching it to a particular tradition, that might be a better way to go. We can just add it right onto the tradition talent tree. And, um, there is no Navigation skill. Knowledge (Galactic Lore) maybe?

Uh that's just scary. I watched and rather enjoyed Farscape including the finale that involved wormhole weapons that worked just like this drive is described... EW!

...well, as I'm working up the history, I started back 25,000 years, and the Gates were built not too long ago ("ish". Like they were built 10 to 15 thousand years ago). So that's where I got the thousands of years ago. But some one would produce more, right? So not all would be that old. And yet, if hyper ships were built to last, they could be.

Astrogation? Use Computer? Underwater Scarf Knitting? Whatever skill you need to enter hyperspace.

Yeah. Hyperliners. The rebuilt remains of long lost civilizations? Oh, you would like to know, wouldn't you?

See previous.
So we want set lanes of travel meaning off-road is expensive and long if at all?
Is it direct dial access or can the phone call be hacked?
Is it hyper liners requiring huge investment for one an payment for travel for the rest?
Are we wanting it the same as GFFA where we introduce the options of hyper capable missle swarms since HDrives are so cheap & prevalent? (or has that been confirmed for me... now I can't recall.)

### **Thraken** (2009-05-06 14:46:00)

I'm commenting on breeder's proposals (top of page 3 on default settings)
I was already writing up the possibility of rich people buying custom destinations (like private charter) and in some cases allowing general users to purchase custom destinations.
I'd have thought good old mass fields would be the yanky out of hyperspacey. Though nothing stopping someone from putting a virus into the nav computer to divert courses (heh heh)
Sounds like hyperliners for the masses if they're mostly ancient ships and they're big and expensive.
Hypermissiles - see big and expensive.
Also - regarding the warp drives, how quick is quick? because the BSG version of this drive is instantaneous.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Hyper Gate**</span>
The facilities vary from place to place ranging from an old patchwork ring in space to massive spaceborn trade complexes arrayed around their rings - however the travel service is relatively standardised. (Use spaceport rules in Scum and Villainy p94 as desired)
Jump schedules are available by open computer access in the vicinity of the Gate (use communications rules if desired) and travelling ships must purchase a jump position for the given journey. Depending on the Gate this may be completely automated, handled by living staff or both. 30 minutes before a given jump alerts begin broadcast and the ships are required to take up their positions (DC10 Pilot) or miss the jump and forfeit their fee.
Generally a custom destination may be purchased by a generous fee, but take place in between scheduled jumps to prevent traffic disruption (unless the fee is *that* generous)
**Hyper Gate Type die**
**D20** Effect
**1-5**  x5 travel time multiplier
**6-13**  x4 travel time multiplier
**14-17** x3 travel time multiplier
**18-19** x2 travel time multiplier
**20**  Roll again, however in addition custom destinations are available for general purchase for a reasonable price.
**Destination**  Frequency
**Major**  Up to hourly
**Normal**  Up to daily
**Minor**  Up to weekly
**Insignificant** Up to monthly
Formatting on here is annoying -_-
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Warp Drive**</span>
A warp drive uses exotic technology in order to punch a hole in space. As the device is fixed to the ship, the entire hull and some surrounding spacetime is sucked through the hole and thus is 'warped' to a space-time position. Uncontrolled it is supremely dangerous - ranging from being totally lost in the universe to ripping the universe a new space time singularity. With a lot of careful calibration however, it is the ultimate interstellar drive.
The drives use the same table values as hyperdrives with the exception of availability and base cost.
The multiplier is used to determine the number of minutes required to charge a Warp Drive for a jump in normal circumstances.
Making a jump is a DC30 astrogation Use Computer check. Nominal jumps are between destinations within the same region. To jump to a distant destination one must have detailed navigation data for the origin and the destination (one day old or less), or attempt to calculate the way to the region. For each region to be traversed, increase the DC by 5.
With an hour of uninterrupted stellar cartography and a DC 30 use computer sensor check, you may reduce the astrogation DC by 5. This may be repeated, however there is only so much navigational data one can obtain from their position. For each subsequent stellar cartography check add 5 to the DC.
If a jump is made using a failed astrogation check, take damage from a failed jump as normal and roll a Major Space Travel Hazard (p99 Scum and Villainy). For every 3 points the check was failed, roll another Major Space Travel Hazard

Do you just mean that the gate offers custom destinations for a reasonable fee (instead of a generous one)? In which case, never mind.
And I would still like to see something included for slicing into gates and setting your own destination (working as regular slicing rules and adding a custom destination or the like).

### **Thraken** (2009-05-20 11:23:43)

Aye, for whatever reason custom destinations are on general offer. Maybe they're not that busy and so would take your money for it. Maybe their admin system is just so awesome they can.
Additions (AKA Wall of Text Attack):

The age of the data available for a given destination is similar to the frequency in which they are travelled from the gate.

### **Rebaav** (2009-05-26 13:08:10)

The inclusion of HRings introduces a whole new dynamic to SW:Kallium that's not in GFFA, such as maintenance and security personel, that are totally seperate from the HDrive dynamic. What might help the fleshing out of the details of HDrive vs HRing culture and RPing opportunities. Since we're making this thing lets look at what we want it to look like and mold it a little.
Since these systems are part of a new 'Net then there is security and trafficking politics and particulars that need to be explored and fleshed out since this is an established tech (been around). Everything that is in HDrive is also in HRing but are not neccesarily overlapping or related, some could be entirely seperate from the other: Privateers/Pirates from HDrive would be seperate from HRing and may never associate. Some differences HRing smuggling, for example, would involve customs officials where HDrive would be safe harbours etc.
This would be the new info 'Net... unless there is also those FTL Holo'nets... I asked that before, where did I put the answer? There's info traders/smugglers/specialists in Star Trek because the FTL comm is out of step with the FTL transit (transit is faster). Was that firmed up? I can't recall right now.
Anyway I'm tired but I thought I'd mention something there, bit rambling but *yawn* & all that.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-05-31 09:16:52)

Hmm... a little logical thought is all I applied really.
Hyper Gates/Rings/Orifices are the cost effective solution. I made up that people hated and feared this as their faith is placed on the Ring operators and it's not an inboard FTL system. i.e. if interdicted or pull out of hyperspace by some phenomenon or pirates they are truly lost in deep space with no way anywhere. Further to this I imagine Gate Operators like to place as much in PR or redundant measures as they can to improve public confidence in the system. I also noted that any illegal use or mistakes in the system would probably cause widespread fears of using the system.
These ancient hyper capable barges of yours may be slow but enjoy great confidence due to the perception of reliability and safety. Being generally large ships they can take a pounding and most importantly an inboard drive allows the crew to react and escape from a situation where they're pulled out of hyperspace. Due to rarity and expense however, this in itself makes it a target for piracy. Generally to assaults on Hyper ships are planned with overwhelming force to enable capture or surrender before it can escape into hyperspace. The specifics of the ships are up to your imagination - ranging from the original old ships to newly built ships, generally owned by large governments or organisations.
While generally expensive enough to bankrupt organisations to build, there is a undying demand for more safe and reliable hyperdrives compared to the available alternatives.
As far as I can tell from that there are two general classes of pirate:
Small time - more often than not those operating in asteroid belts or edges of populated systems where there is FTL access where they can interdict Gate travellers. Or conceivably a system cut off from intergalactic travel but luckily in the path of a hyper route they can raid.
Big time - large organisations which have the power to take Hyper capable ships, possibly with some FTL tech of their own enabling operations from isolated bases. (which in Kalium's FTL restricted environment, could be almost anywhere they want and almost impossible to detect)
I was under the impression Holonet was determined by whatever the local government does about it, so not handled here. I also don't know what you mean about information dealing in star trek. FTL communications is faster than travel.

This implies, to me, a high level of control & oversight for those invested in the HRing. A HRing button-pushers guild, screened and trained and of a certain elite, in some systems anyway. Neat. I suppose some fiction presented would flesh things out for me more, stories about ring hackers and such and portable one-shot rings for pirating that self destruct after activation. I'm recalling the ID systems used in Earth Final Conflict and the Transit Authorities there, death of the airlines etc.

Makes deep space mission probes, off-grid(HRing) sojourns into the vast unexplored black etc etc, an interesting project for some political entities. I'm still trying to wrap my head around just how this will look when in place, I appreciate the efforts!

I'd expect this would not last long on a line with any significant traffic. I see a large military contingent being 'raided' at some point. I'd assume, then, that a ship transiting between 2 HRings can be tracked using the HRings themselves. Any point where the pathway/hyperlane seems weak (where ships tend to disappear for example) would be investigated by HRing troubleshooters, emphasis on the 'shooter' part.

Ah but the rewards good sir! The Rewards! Har!

Just looking for some input on the distribution of information whenever there is discussion of FTL travel. How wide-spread info is, and it's speed of update, can be a significant defining quality of an RPG setting, from what I've seen anyway. Heck just look at IRL and it's effects. In a SciFi or future setting it's effects are either magnified significantly or regulated to near stranglehold. My limited exposure again but just trying to help out.

Ah, my fault. I was recalling something about lag-time but I'd forgotten the distance in those instances (vast). I always thought the info-courier stuff was neat in any sci-fi but my exposure to it is far more limited than I like. In STrek there was a race that speciailized in it, don't recall the name. I'd love to see that with Kalium, the Bothans, somehow, don't seem to fit the bill for me. *shrug*

Neat. I suppose some fiction presented would flesh things out for me more, stories about ring hackers and such and portable one-shot rings for pirating that self destruct after activation. I&#39;m recalling the ID systems used in Earth Final Conflict and the Transit Authorities there, death of the airlines etc.

Me no fictionary. Me gizmo crunchary.
the one shot rings sound interesting, but FTL is no simple stuff! Mid-big time pirates? ;D

Indeed, exploration is looking a bit dicey. I imagine that's largely brave and expensive expeditions with a hyperspace ship. e.g. Kalium's USS Enterprise would probably be a fully kitted out hawt Colossal (cruiser) but it's drive is more than likely one salvaged from an ancient ship.
Of course if they're that brave they could just calculate the position of a star and zap there with a Warp ship

I&#39;d assume, then, that a ship transiting between 2 HRings can be tracked using the HRings themselves. Any point where the pathway/hyperlane seems weak (where ships tend to disappear for example) would be investigated by HRing troubleshooters, emphasis on the &#39;shooter&#39; part.

Note that the gate system afaik was described as a one way launcher. no second ring required. So I guess you could get the destination info from the launcher gate, or just camp a spot between the gate and the destination.
The difficulty is why I'd generally separated small time and big time. Small time have to keep mobile or hidden (say disguised as civilian ships but they meet up for some buccaneering now and again) so moving to big time is actually a major difference.

There's plenty of sources we can pillage for this. A gate operator may hypertransceiver or holonet data between its gates depending on service and equipment available. This is likely the most up to date.
Organisations with hyperspace ships may do the same or may also set up a navigation data servers/beacons or contract other organisations to do so to keep up to date info that they can get and upload by FTL comms.
If you aren't on good terms with one of these or they're just not selling you might want to contact some space mapping/astronomy organisation (not likely in less civilised systems)

Yridians (major geek) but that's a generalisation much like the 'Bothans', there was no particular special ability. Note however that in kalium Holonet is spotty (dependant on governments) so otherwise it's just hypertransceivers which not everyone has and lag significantly with distance.
However we have warp drives that can zap ships across the galaxy instantaneously ;D Risky. But fast! Crazy Courier Service anyone?

Ah this explains things. I'd thought that the rings established a more stablized transit tube between 2 HRings, I imagined that, clearly. nvm!
Given that, it makes the one-shot rings all the more viable and interesting. The energy for the hop generated from the power cell detonating and destroying the rig. Very neat and likely exployed as a back-up for HDrive liners. This also removes any "connection" between 2 HRings and therefore wipes out what I was talking about... unless the data packets were "launched" and "caught". Those could be intercepted, perhaps, but they'd be no doubt encrypted. Hrm.
This makes for Crazy Clown Couriers and info dealers a not-so-niche market and a rather booming industry! Messy. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

maybe we should go pester the boss for a sitewide go or no go poll for this >_>

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-02 15:54:11)

You can throw my vote in for it. I like what I see. A lot. Makes me wish I had spent more time on it so I could take some credit. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
If you want to create poll, are you going to do each part separately or just throw up a "yes" or "no" answers for it? While the latter is easier (and saves more time), the former would make sure everyone's happy with what we get. Of course, then we run the risk of getting contrasting views. Something to think about, anyway.
As for a fiction piece, I'm supposed to write a short story this month about Fear and Pharmaceuticals. (Don't ask.) I can work in a hypergate and pirates easily--especially since I had no ideas yet about what I was going to write. How 'bout it?

*Shrugs* I'm just developing off Breeder's notes in this thread due to impatience. Where is the old boy anyway?
The poll would be yes, no or post in the damn Travel and Hyperspace thread!!

He's around, I just don't think he gets to post as often as he'd like. I'm still waiting on his history to stick in the pdf. It'd be nice to have his opinions, though, since his are usually good (if not always agreeing with everyone else's).

If thar be no nay saying I think I'll be requesting the forum wide poll after all...

A back handed comment if I ever heard one.
Thanks.
I am trying to post more, but am currently distracted by...quite a few things.

You're welcome. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> It wasn't meant to be back-handed, it just came out that way.
I know you're busy, so don't worry about it. We can hold down the galaxy without you. I think.
