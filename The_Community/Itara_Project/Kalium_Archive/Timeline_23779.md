The species (blank, blank, and blank), having discovered space travel and explored their own systems, all met at the Jonus system. The initial contacts were peaceful yet tense, and called off the exploration of the Jonus system. This stalemate would last for thousands of years.

**Formation of the Galactic Scale**

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

After ten centuries, dozens of species had added to the galactic society, comprising solely of the area now known as the Core Worlds. Relations between species were tense despite various trade agreements, with minor border clashes occurring with increasing frequency. Five hundred years after First Contact, the first galactic organization, called the Galactic Scale (GS), had been instituted, keeping the peace by ordering a series of compensations when a breech of one species' territory or resources. The GS had no power of their own, relying instead on the cooperation of the various factions to enforce its dictates.

**War of the Resources**

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

In the last years of the GS, several species- all peaceful by nature- overcame the barrier formed by their species, and formed a strong, lasting alliance. This alliance, referred to others as the Rowan Conglomerate (RC), allowed all the involved species to prosper in art, technology, and wealth.
Seeing the RC grow in power and size, seizing what they saw was rightfully theirs, the (blank) and (blank) also form an alliance. This alliance, what became known as the first Pirate Agreement, was not as well founded as the RC, and existed only for the profit of the two species that formed it. The Pirate Agreement formed, funded, trained, and instructed pirate bands to raid the RC cargo vessels, ship yards, colonies, and even to conduct raids on the RC's homeworlds.
The RC brought the matter before the GS, accusing the two species of the Pirate Agreement as the ultimate culprits. The GS, professing lack of proper evidence, did order light compensation on behalf of the RC. The Pirate Agreement delayed and stalled paying even that, citing the fact they were quite poor when compared to the RC. Meanwhile, the raids continued.
The RC, having lost too many of its citizens to the pirate raids, decided to take matters into their own hands. The peaceful species put their efforts into the matter of war, and in a few short years, built up an armada. This armada traveled to systems of the RC's enemies, and razed each one. The galactic society was in an uproar, and hailed the GS for action. The GS passed several resolutions, beginning with financial restitution, and ending with the disbandment of the RC and the surrender of its territories. The RC flatly refused, seeing themselves as the victims. The galaxy united against the RC, and strove to silence the wakened dragon.
Though powerful, the RC was not strong enough to stand against the combined galaxy. However, it didn't have to. Secret messages, filled promises of wealth and captured worlds, made their way to the strongest of the Core Worlds. Within weeks, the formerly united galaxy fell apart. Battles raged as every faction sought to force this system of that system into their fold. The RC attempted to withdraw and stay out of the chaos they brought, but too many saw their wealth- or the reputation of wealth- and sought to take it.
While the bloodiest battles were fought within the first two decades, small skirmishes continued the Border Wars until almost a century later. The Galactic Scale was very quietly disbanded sometime during that time.

**Founding of the Firaxian Colony**

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

What could have been nothing so important as a footnote in the galactic history, later events would draw greatly from this one moment. A hyperspace ship, filled with colonists bound for a planet a the outer rim of the known galaxy, suffered a mishap during its travel, and ended up crashing into an uncolonized world. The survivors, including a small order of monks seeking to escape from the war torn galaxy, found themselves on a lush, tropical planet filled with vast natural resources. More ever, when space flight was remade, the system was found to littered with habitable planets and home to multiple mineral rich asteroid belts. The survivors named the system after one of the monks who kept them alive during the first few, terrifying weeks. Thus, the Jonas system was renamed Firaxia.

**The Golden Century**
-7000
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Marcus Tain, who would later take on the title of the Silver Emperor, took center stage more than five hundred years ofter the Border Wars were declared over. A political mastermind and certified genius, Tain began his historic life as a member of a militia member of the Andorian Unity (AU). When Tain must have been very new to the militia, the AU was conquered by the Trader's Conglomerate (TC), an event that was a repetition of the previous two thousands years, and would be repeated back and forth over the next eight thousand years. This was the moment Tain was said to become interested in history, as well as the moment he became disgusted with the repetition of it.
The militia became a pirate band, but within five short years, they were rebels in there own system, with Marcus Tain at their head. Within another five years, the AU was reformed, and the TC was not only expelled from the system, but brought to heel as allied power. Through military might, political savvy, devious cunning, and above all, unsurmountable will, Marcus Tain brought each and every system under his banner. On his sixtieth birthday, Marcus Tain was crowned the Silver King, Emperor of the Galaxy, a title none have held before him, and none have held after him. Yet.
With a galaxy's wealth to draw from, the Silver King implemented projects undreamed of in previous ages. Dozens of sentient species were contacted, hundreds of wonders were built, thousands of worlds were colonized. The galaxy grew in leaps and bounds, in technology, culture, wealth, and art. Nowhere else in history did so much happen in such a short time.
The most important event, however, was the creation of the Hyper Rings.
**Creation of the Hyper Rings**
Hyperspace travel was incredibly slow and dangerous, requiring massive ships, complex calculations, and enormous amounts of energy. Most systems were lucky to have enough resources for one hyperspace capable ship, and should it fall in battle of be lost during transit, that system would be crippled for a generation or more. Communication was also painfully slow, often relying on those same ships to carry mail and sub-space communication pods with them. Battle fleets were sent out and deployed some distance from the target planet, and the hyperspace ship would jump back to the safety of its home system. When it jumped back, full of troops, it was hoped some of the original forces would still be alive to guard its entrance.
Marcus Tain ordered a better way to be found, and the scientists delivered. Hyper Rings, huge devices that could sling whole fleets across the galaxy in the fraction of the time a normal hyperspace ship cold travel, with next to no error, were brought from the drawing board and placed firmly into reality. The plans for such devices were spread through the known galaxy, and the construction of more than a hundred rings were started in less than a decade of their conception. Before the end of the century, more than a hundred thousand Hyper Rings would be built.
Marcus Tain was known to be a fair, if harsh leader, an no single group suffered under his rule. His underlings, however, were not known for this particular trait. The first three species (blank, blank, and blank), those that made first contact, discovered their prize system of Jonas, the very system the three had been in conflict over for the last three thousand years, was indeed colonized. Not only was it colonized, by the population was thriving, and the planets were filled to the brim with strong, healthy individuals.
Uncaring on the how and why's of Fraxia's existence, the First Three descended upon the planet with indigent rage. The Fraxian's people were ill prepared for the onslaught, and hundreds of thousands were killed. Rage still unrequited, the First Three took the survivors and put them to work, strip mining the planets and building Hyper Rings, citing over three thousand years of unpaid taxes. The Fraxian people lived as slaves for almost a decade before they struck back, only days after the Hyper Ring they built themselves in their system was completed.
The monks who were survivors of the fateful crash on Fraxia, a small, simple order called the Bendu, were skilled in a strange mystic art, tapping into a power known as the White Current. This they had taught to their descendants, and they to theirs, and so on. Until the invasion of the Fraxia, it had never been used in battle, reserved only for prediction and healing. But after two decades of slavery, the White Current became a surprising and potent weapon. Before anyone realized what was going on, the users of the White Current had retaken their system, forcing the fleets of the First Three to retreat.
The Silver King received word of the disturbance, and acted quickly to still the dissidence, least it leak into the rest of the galaxy. A small, deadly efficient fleet was formed, and it leaped through it's gate to the Fraxia system, the Silver King himself on the bridge of the command ship. Once there, Marcus Tain wasted no time suppressing the rebellion, crushing it within days. The survivors were rounded up and deposited Fraxia Prime.
Two days later, over the Fraxians staged a massive escape attempt, and over half of the survivors managing to make it to the Hyper Ring, escaping into uncharted space. The Silver King forbade an escape attempt, and pardoned the remaining Fraxians, with the only condition they become functioning members of his empire. The Fraxians agreed.
It is of special note the rumors surrounding the escape from Fraxia. As a matter of course, the Silver King had surrounded himself with military geniuses, and was by in large a brilliant man himself. He was also a man of solid law, never wavering in his judgments, impartial to all. Why he allowed most of the troops guarding the prisoners and ship yards take part in the victory celebration when his normal tactics was to solidly hold anything he had taken is unknown. Why he had forbade the pursuit of the escapees, when he had always hunted down any enemy is another mystery. And why he immediately moved his capital to Fraxia is also a matter of some debate. But this was a how the Silver King decreed, and therefore unquestioned at the time.
The Fraxia Hyper Gate was re-tasked to point into a different location, and the Silver King's capital was relocated to Fraxia Prime (this is now regarded as a political move, as the Silver King's capital was untouchable). Shortly there after, the entire system was deemed a nature reserve, and only the Silver King's private ships allowed enter the system. Though damaged by the harsh decade of the rape of natural resources by the first three, the Fraxia system was slowly rebuilt into the pristine beauty it once had. The process took three centuries.
The Silver King himself, left the Fraxia system, never to return.

**Death of the Silver King and the First Intergalactic War**
-6900
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

All great ages come to an end, and the Golden Century was not any different. Within days of Marcus Tain's death, amid the cries of â€œClone him! Clone him now!â€ shouted by the public, the new leaders took direct control over their sectors, and went to war. Without the Silver King, with his unified military, his genius, and his unshakable will, the galaxy could not, would not hold together.
Grudges made to simmer for the pass century flared with new life, burning swathes through the citizens and troops, igniting the firestorm to burn, to purge, purify...any others who stood in their way. Some factions sought to keep the galaxy whole to honor the fallen king, other wanted it so they might control it Others sought an unbroken thrown not for themselves, but for the simple fact with someone on that throne, there would be peace similar to that under Silver King. Yet others...others wanted no throne at all, and instead sought freedom unknown under the rule of a galactic monarch.
The First Intergalactic War lasted five decades, and touched every citizen in the galaxy. Those that did not fight in the war knew some one who did. Seven in ten recruits that left to fight the war ever came home, five of which came home in caskets. Every planet bent under the weigh of war taxes, battle construction, and enemy bombing runs. Some planets broke, their economies unable to bear the loss of their work force for troops, nor the loss of wealth to taxes, or the constantly higher and higher demands of weapons, tanks, and ships to the commanding militarizes.
The warriors quickly rid themselves of any visage of civility early in the war, hoping for one brutal strike to end the hostiles. Civilian infrastructure was targeted, in hopes to kill the war machine at it's roots, but instead renewed the vigor of those so assaulted, spurring the supposed victims to great fervor to defeat the 'criminals' and 'terrorists'.
Like the Golden Century, many acts acts that took place during this time shaped the current shape of the galaxy, but there is not enough space here to list them all. Instead, small items of note are listed below:
**The Warrior Path of Fraxia**
Early during the war, several factions sought to take hold of the Fraxia system, the symbolic center of the galaxy and the place Marcus Tain labeled his capital (the fact the Silver King only visited there once, and stayed less than a month, mattered little). Though there were a few elite defenders, it was thought to be an easy target for such its importance. This belief was quickly corrected.
Those Fraxian people who were pardoned by the Silver King had adapted the discoveries they made during their revolt, turning their potent abilities to that of warfare and defense, from hand-to-hand combat to combat void craft. Though small in number, they fought with exceptional skill, precise movements, and unsurpassed coordination. They also proved to have unequal intelligence, knowing within minutes when a fleet was inbound to attempt a capture of the system. At least two full fleets were captured, through boarding actions and the ships unharmed, shortly after they exited the Hyper Gates, and many more were destroyed.
Eventually, after the importance of the system faded into memory, the system formerly known as Jonus, was left alone.
Other factions, seeking an edge on against their enemies, rushed to Fraxia to hire or train under the 'new warrior monks'. It is known that the elder members of the order of mystic warriors refused to teach any seeking war and not defending peace, but the younger, more idealistic members- following a idealogical path called 'Jedi'- left their home system, bringing the strange and powerful art into the galaxy at large. Like all idealists, some grew to regret their decisions, why others preformed the greatest of atrocities in the name of 'the greater good'.
**The Ysanna Incident**
But the Fraxia people were not the only ones access to other worldly abilities. Formed before the war, the Ysanna was a intergalactic police force, crossing all borders, to hunt down criminals and reinforce the laws. Usually accepted with open arms in most of the places the visited, these hutt law officers were sometimes shunned due to their heavy handed approach to justice. It was not widely known then they, too, were skilled in an art similar the Fraxian 'Jedi', though with different teachings and uses.
The secret became an open fact with one hutt, Ju'tta the Crone, was captured by the Gregorian Alliance (GA), and order to instruct the GA's troops in her order's abilities. Her and a dozen other families of many species were held as ransom to force her obedience. Ju'tta refused, broke free, and after a terrible battle, forced all of the GA soldiers off the space station where she and the other captives were being held. Ju'tta held off every attempt to recapture the station for two full months, both from the GA and other forces seeking the Ysaana's secrets. Eventually, when the GA grew too weary of their void craft being crushed outside the station by unseen hands, and hearing of their troops being ripped apart inside, they simple destroyed the station.
Still, Ju'tta had made her mark on the galaxy, and no one attempted to force a Ysanna to give up their secrets again.
**Raising of the Bridges and the Rise of the Jedi**
Hyper Rings made it easy for a system to send a fleet to any nearly anywhere in the known galaxy. During the reign of the Silver King, each Ring's destination was set, only re-tasked upon command of Marcus Tain himself. But with the Silver King dead, ownership, thus control, over a Hyper Rings fell to those whose orbited that particular Ring. Early in the war, that title feel to whoever owned the system. Later, as systems feel to other factions, ownership of the Ring changed hands often, sometimes even in the middle of a battle.
After a time, it became evident to many factions that the Hyper Rings offered too many easy entrance into their systems, and more importantly, allowed enemy factions egress from their own systems. The Rings themselves, the key to interstellar trade, soon became military targets. Though far from fragile and undefended, a Hyper Ring could be brought down, as was first proven in the Tagnagga system. The operators of the Hyper Ring fought hard for their lives, but in the end, their bodies were sent plummeting to surface of Tagnagga III, striking with enough force to bring a cataclysmic ice age to the planet.
Other Hyper Rings fell, vaporized in the void by enemy fleets, starved to death by picket fleets, or torn asunder by sabotage. Some Rings were destroyed strictly because they were links in a chain one enemy used to attack another, while other systems suffered because of whom they were allied with. In the Yottow system, the Ring was destroyed by the TC because their enemy at the time, the Lillian Pool (LP) often raided the Yottow system for food and minerals.
The lost of any Ring understandably caused some difficulty in the transportation of war craft, but also played hell with commerce, and, more importantly, communications. Sub-light communication transversed the empty spaces between the void in time measured in years, instead of hours like the message pods shot through the Hyper Rings. Military intelligence was lost, stuck in systems that used to operate as mere stopping points. Worse still, whole fleets never got accurate received word of fallen gates, or knowledge of broken and reformed treaties, causing mass confusion, lost fleets, stranded war ships, and pointless battles.
Meanwhile, in the Yottow system, a hero stood in the ashes of her fallen world.
**Ara Noor and the Stabilization**
A member of the Jedi Defenders, a branch of the Fraxia monks who dedicated themselves to the protection of innocents, Ara Noor was on Yottow III when the Ring fell. She was among several hundred thousand that survived the impact of the Ring, and only one of a handful that survived the terrible thousand year winter that followed. She was aboard the ancient Hyper Ship that left the system a few years later, seeking to find some sort of aid to send to those still trapped on the other planets of the ruined system. And when she reached the nearby system, and discovered the chaos of the galaxy had become, she became the end of the First Intergalactic War.
Emboldened by the horrors brought by the death of each Hyper Ring, Ara Noor took action. Within weeks of arriving to a still functioning Hyper Ring, the Jedi- with the help of an unknown slicer- seized control over it. When a fleet arrived to disable it, Ara Noor and her mysterious slicer had already reprogrammed the Ring, and used it to micro-jump an asteroid through the offending fleet . The weapon systems of the Ring easily mopped up the shredded remains of the fleet. After securing a truly neutral crew for the Ring- along with the support of the local system- the Jedi left for another Ring.
While she could never reach every Hyper Ring, she reached enough that the entire galaxy got the hint. She was joined by the Ysanna, who followed her example in insuring no other Rings would be destroyed. Independent parties seized control where Ara Noor and the Ysanna couldn't reach, enforcing the same rules- neutrality to all parties, protection from destruction- to any Ring that one faction controlled. Others attempted to re-task the Rings as weapons, as Ara Noor and her slicer had done, but few succeeded. Those that did were the next to be visited by the Jedi and her growing band of followers. Those that figured out how to weaponize the Hyper Ring vanished, or were simpled killed.
Then, when almost every Ring was under control of Ara Noor or those who sided with her, the Jedi shut the galaxy down. Over eighty percent of the gates were shut down, allowing no traffic, be it military, commerce, or otherwise- was allowed through, all save the message pods Ara Noor herself sent through to the various factions. The imposed blockade lasted a month while the Jedi worked out a cease fire between the factions. It was not true peace, but established borders, and ended the massive scale of bloodshed that the galaxy had been soaked in. Only then did she allow the Rings to activate. Any attempt to violate the agreements resulted in the fleets in question to be denied access to the Ring. Any abuse of the Rings resulted in the fleet begin jumped to an uncharted location, or worse. In the case of the Valerin Combine and it's seizure of the Prindle system with converted cargo vessels, the entire fleet was jumped into the Valerin sun.
The identity of the mysterious slicer was never discovered, or, should the author be allowed to guess, his/her/it's identity was destroyed by that same slicer. Of the creature's existence there is no doubt- innumerable sources establish this beyond a doubt. The name, species, or an shred of history prior to Ara Noor of this unknown sentient remains undiscovered.
**Birth of the Sith**
Even though the comparison of the recorded histories, the exact year- or even decade- in which the Sith was formed is still in question. It is known that the escapees of the Fraxia wandered the stars for some time before settling (some say crashed) upon Sunderhome. Unlike the Jonas system, it was not a lush, resource heavy land, but a harsh system, lacking anything comforts, filled with threats so dangerous they are equaled only rarely in the known galaxy. Here, the disposed Fraxians made their home, struggling as best they could to survive.
The population was decimated in the first generation. The noble leaders of the displaced colony died from disease, predators, and natural disasters, and the Fraxians assumed a more barbaric lifestyle, becoming wandering tribes who raided each other for supplies for survival. Their chosen religion, the path which the practiced this mystical arts they were feared for, was all but lost in the savagery.
One man rose above the others, and brought order to the planet. Edrik Carn, son of one of the original Fraxians and one of the few who still possessed the vaulted powers of his ancestors, conquered the planet, one tribe at a time. It was his will and charisma that brought trade, technology, discipline, and unity back to the Fraxian people. A select few were taught his mystical art, and they taught others. This new path, mutated and adjusted for their new, harsher planet, was called the way of the Sith, bearing little resemblance to the order of Bendu, or their Jedi offshoots. But it proved more than enough to gather all of Sunderhome under Edrik Carn's flag, and bring order back to his people.
After the planet was brought under control, Edrik Carn looked out to the stars, and set about extending the reach of the Sith. Every planet in the Sunderhome system was colonized. Designs of hyper craft, found in the ruins of the original colony, were found and utilized. The nearest systems were search, colonized, and the empire grew. Other systems were found, colonized, and the processed repeated.
Other species were discovered. Edrik Carn, remembering what the rest of the galaxy was like at war and raised on the story of Marcus Tain, allowed no other factions inside his empire. Each species was given a choice to join under his rule, or be annihilated. Few choose to oppose him, and their descriptions are entered into the recorded histories, the only remains of their legacy. Those that joined prospered, their cultures mixing with that of the Sith. And the empire grew steadily under the careful gaze of Edrik Carn, the first Sith.
It is an important note that Edrik Carn was alive during this period, and in truth, could easily still walk the soil of one world or another. Exactly how he managed this feat is unknown; if it was an aspect of his mystical powers, it was something he did not teach his followers. But it was his direct leadership and centuries of experience that allowed the Sith to grow as the did. His hatred for the galaxy that cast out his parents, the memories of the Silver King, and the chaos he was born to also shaped the Sith, and through them, the rest of the galaxy.

**The Droid Explosion**
-6000 to -5900
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

After nearly a century of war after the death of the Silver King, muted from the chaotic symphony of total war to the steady thrumming of small conflicts and tidy skirmishes by the actions of Ara Noor and her brood, the population of the galaxy was less than ten percent of what it was at the height of the Golden Century. Farm fields were left to go to weed without sufficient bodies to work the fields, factories, long relying more on robotic workers than human, continued to run fairly smoothly, but lacked the raw materials to feed their enormous machinery. Even with the Hyper Rings open, allowing trade to flood each systems within reach, the lack of healthy workers crippled the once powerful factions. The future looked bleak as food stores and other necessary supplies dwindled.
The answer came from the TC, though rumor has it they stole the secret from another source. In the early part of the year, the TC scientists made a genuine break through in droid processors- the heuristic processor. Previously, droids were intelligent, but could learn- all skills had to be developed on a computer, then loaded into the droids brain. If the droid met an obstacle not covered in their programing, they couldn't get around it. In the simplest of droids, this meant even the slightest change in the usual parameters- such as weather- would cause them to shut-down.
This all changed with the introduction of the heuristic processor. Worker droids equipped with the new processor could be taught through verbal instructions, for experience, or by watching. The the memory upgrades that accompanied the new discovery, droids remember what they had been taught, and could teach other, properly equipped, droids. Factions drained their coffers fund the necessary to bring upgrades, betting against the future in face of being driven back into the stone age by their ancestors war. The bet paid off. Though the start up was slow- gaining the raw materials to build the new droids and upgrading old ones, was slow, once it picked up speed, factories, mines, farms and businesses boomed with the inflow of new, durable workers.
Consequently, the slave trade was all put at an all time low.
By the end of the year, trade had more than double the previous year, and ten times that the following year. Because droids took over most of the harsher tasks, the bulk of the galaxy experienced greater health, promoting more births and a greater lifespan. Naturally, the population grew exponentially. Within less than five decades, the galaxy was back on the rise. Talk of another Golden century spread.
Strangely, a much over looked fact during this depression was the generosity of the TC. The normally brutally mercenary faction freely sold the designs to the heuristic processor at barely any profit, despite the realization of its possible impact. There is also rumor that the TC wickedly enforced it's low prices, insuring the new designs were sold as cheaply as possible, resorting to some truly harsh tactics to insure cooperation. Though much speculation have been given about that decision, the exact reason remains unknown. The TC remains silent about the subject to this day.

**Age of Stilled Holocaust**
-5900 to -5000
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

With the advent of the heuristic processor, other scenarist strove hard for new and exciting breakthroughs. Only during the Golden Century was there ever such a large leap in technological advancement. New or refined energy sources were established, cloning was brought to an affordable level, new crops were gene-crafted, new medicines further increased the health of the average citizen. This, some claimed, was the new Golden Century. But the galaxy was not held together by a single figure, and there were always conflicts. Great weapons were produced along side the new trideo systems, deadlier void craft soon populated space while upgrade tot he Hyper Rings were installed, and troops learned how to used the new armors as better fuels powered farm equipment.
Some examples of items either created or refined to the point of usefulness during this age are listed below:
Bacta fluid, Landar ion engines (the style the present day models are based on), energy shields (refined to the point of single pilot ships could carry them), ion cannons, vast improvements on hyper ships (the Hyper Rings were still too cheap for this option to see much use), ratheon repluser engines (basis of present day repulsers), shock and vibro weaponry (refined to cost effectiveness), cloning (refined, especially in flash imprint training), zero-g harvesting (refined until cost effective), and plasma blade weaponry (created, still too expensive for common use), as well as the addition of the Intra-Hyper Ring Communication Network (I-Net).
The first device labeled a 'super-weapon' was demonstrated on an unpopulated planet. The titanic mass driver, built by the A'urian Foudation (AF) and borrowing heavily from Ara Noor's defensive use of the Hyper Rings, could rapidly sling a large series of asteroids into a planet at a high rate of speed- almost one a minute, provided a ready supply of ammunition. It was again used four years later, against the Prague Directorate (PD), leveling the city-factories on the moons of Julian VII. Unknown forces- though the Jedi were suspected- later seized and self-destructed the great machine, but the war between the AF and PD was already well on it's way.
Other super weapons were produced, such as the Hyperion Fleet and the Apopcolypica chemical weapon station, and their use was threatened against opposing forces. Few actually saw repeated use, however. Most were destroyed by one group or another, either after their first use or before. Factions started to train and keep special units whose sole purpose to was seize and capture or destroy new super weapons. Few survive to this day:
**Center Point Station**
A huge fortress station littered with anti-ship weapons of all shapes and sizes, with the greatest collection of shield generators of its time, the station was designed to withstand any amount of punishment. It's zero-point generator, a high fickle device capable of creating a momentary blackhole-like effect anywhere within 10 lightyears made it a fearsome weapon. Though the firing of the weapon required several days of preparation- and even then, the on-board super computer often denied the plotted target due to last second changes in the void- and the effect lasted less than a second, it could draw everything within a half of a lightyear into a space no bigger than a cubic meter. The station managed to vanquish two fleets sent to seize or destroy it before it too was put out of commission. While the station was completely unassailable, the planets that brought food and fresh air to the station were not. The crew of Center Point Station were starved to death.
Currently, the station is still floating around the planet it was built (it requires a Hyper Ring for FTL travel), the super computer reputably still be pulling guard until some one with the proper genetic code to enter and reactivate the system.
**The Harrier Project**
It is unknown which faction created the Harriers. The idea of completely automated droid factories producing unlimited amounts of combat droids and autonomous fighter craft was scary enough several group abandoned them in the design stages. However, some one did create three such factories, and worst, installed the factories on Hyper Ships.
All of the Harrier droids were linked to a single super computer named Mother. Twenty minutes after she was given complete control over the factories, Mother ordered her 'children' to eradicate all living creatures within the system.
The Harriers proceed to hyper jump to the close Hyper Ring and attempted to destroy it, conquering two of the planets in the system and stripping them of all of their resources in the attempt. However, the Ring was able to send out a cry for help, and the Black Storm, the only other function super weapon at the time, fired three of its electromagnetic rounds through the Ring at it's location and, with the aid of the Ring's targeting system, destroyed one of the factories, and heavily damaged the other two. The Harriers hyper jumped out of the system, abandoning their assault, and was not seen again for several thousand years.
The Harriers are considered the last successfully built â€œsuper weaponâ€ of that age.

**Kalium Peace**
-4500 to -3000
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

After the defeat of the Harrier fleet and its subsequent flight, an almost peaceful mood settled on the galaxy. Though the intervening time was hardly of of peace- at anyone time, there were at least two major wars between multiple factions, decorated with hundreds of smaller skirmishes filling in the gaps- it was one without any major events, excluding, perhaps, the control of a system or two changing hands and a few, inconsequential technological advancements. The fifteen hundreds years before the Black Plague is often used as a base line when figuring the importance of an event on the galactic level.
Due to the turbulent nature of the Kalium Galaxy, such times as these are often referred to as Kalium Peace.

**The Fracturing of the Sith**
-4000 to -3500
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

In the Sith controlled space, an empire continued to grow and expand at a slow, by steady pace. The Sith mantra of â€œBy life of by your history,l you shall join our Empireâ€ was repeated hundreds of times, with thousands of worlds taking the road of self-preservation.
The Sith was not a static society, learning and adapting each culture that joined it's ranks, tying the various parts into a solid, diverse whole. Each new culture and species brought new approaches to old problems. Edrik Carn understood the new for growth and fresh blood, often using the comparison of a tree in a still pond become stunted and sick, while one next to a stream would prosper and grow. To provide an example of his dedication to this ideal, Edrik Carn stepped down as the Sith Overlord, allowing another to take his place in the bloodless succession of power. Terms of five year increments- with most Overlords serving four or five terms- were set, with each Overlord naming their successor. Always, however, Edrik Carn stood near the Overlord, bringing his centuries of experience and greater understanding of mystical power to bear whenever called.
Some Overlords, however, did not let go the reigns of ultimate power so easily, or peacefully. Twice, Overlords were pressured into resigning, but more often an Overlord as assassinated after refusing to step aside.
One such Overlord, Yannen Fain, had the remarkable talent to avoid proper assassination. Rumored to have taken with madness, he refused all contact with Edrik Carn, disbanded his advisors, and set about locking empire with harsh and oppressive laws. Dissidence began to creep into the empire as various species and cultures suffered usually high burdens and taxes, while favorite of the Overlord were heaped with luxuries. Calls for equality fell on cold hearts, bringing only harsher laws and more oppressive punishments.
The Sith Lords, formerly of the Overlord Fain's advisors, sought Edrick Carn when the mad overlord refused to relinquish his post. The First Monarch was nowhere to be found. Taking matters into their hands, the Sith Lords choose a new Overlord from among their number, Eolanda Farnight, and declared Fain's rule at a end. The empire erupted into civil war as loyalists to the Overlord battled the upstarts, each claiming the other as impostors. Each went as far as to claim Edrick Carn sided with their own side, though in truth, no one had seen the First Monarch since a decade before the war started.
The Sith civil war, known as the Fracturing, lasted only fifty years, a short time for a war in the Kalium Galaxy, but cause irreparable damage to the once untied Sith. The Expedition Fleet, comprised of the best and most experienced warriors of the Sith, was as divided as the rest of the empire, leading to many bloody battles. As if a twisted, secular parody of the rest of the galaxy, the Sith mirrored the atrocities and horrors committed so many lightyears away, all in the name of the Sith empire.
The end of the war was sudden and came in the form of an image appearing in every Sith's mind. Throughout the empire, the same image, that of Edrick Carn's visage, standing over the dismembered corpse of Yannen Fain, stilled all battles, ending any doubt on who the First Monarch sided with. The Fracturing was over. What was to follow, however, was 400 years of bloodshed.
Edrick Carn refused retake his place as Overlord, stating time and again his time was done. â€œThis garden is another's to manage and shape. I will, instead,â€ he stated, â€œsee about removing some very toxic weeds.â€ Thus began a steady, blood purge of the Sith lords and faction leaders that had sided with Fain during the Fracturing. Edrick Carn did not stop at with the leaders, personally overseeing the deaths of their families and greatest supporters. Few went peacefully, while most fought hard agaisnt the First Monarch and his forces. Some plead innocence, saying they were merely following the Overlord, as they would have followed Edrick Carn. All died.
The message was clear: none shall threaten the Sith.
Still, the First Monarch's actions, designed to destroy forces inside the empire that threatened to break it, worked deeper cracks into the splintering domain. Quiet rebellions were formed, meetign in secert, exchanging worries at first, and then theories. Some whispered that Edrick Carn was going made, his advanced age eating at his mind, perhaps, or that whatever ailment befell Fain had infected him. Why else would the First Monarch sit by and watch the Overlord almost destroy the empire, not interfering until the last moment? Why else would he slaughter those whose only thoughts were to keep the empire united, no matter the cost?
None would dare stand directing in the way of the First Monarch, however, nor his chosen Overlord. Instead, the Silent Rebels, as they called themselves, split into two groups. One would build an army in secret, preparing for the worst possible event. The other would work within the established system, until they could removed Edrick Carn from power. To do that, they decided, the Silent Rebels would need one of their own as Overlord. But, as their ways of thinking opposed the current Overlord, it would be sometime before anyone of their own would hold hat seat. A faster way needed to be used.
What followed was a long series of assassinations, 'accidents', and scandals to each Overlord, though several years- even as much as a five year term- separated each death or embarrassment. When a Silent Rebel finally was chosen as the Overlord, it looked as if the death was over. It was not to be, as he too was killed before the end of his first term. Assassination, blackmail, and treachery had become the way to power in the Sith Empire. No amount of allies would save anyone from death's embrace.
After the slaying of Falin's supporters, Edrick Carn disappeared. It is unknown where went, although he has appeared to the Expedition Fleet every few decades, using current security codes to gain admission. Each time, he would send the fleet to its next conquest, yet the First Monarch never stayed long enough to see the task complete. He did not reappear before another Overlord for a thousand years.

**The Black Plague**
-3000
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Five hundreds years after the Harrier fleet had disappeared, a new threat had arrived in the galaxy. This one, borne on the wings of air, did not come with blasters or lasers, without bombs and torpedoes, but with a simple cough, a sneeze, followed but gut wrenching pain and the tearing of internal organs. A disease unlike any other sprang up in the core worlds, and from there, quickly spread through out the galaxy.
Named the Black Plague, it was unique in it's ability to infect any living creature, though it appeared to have a distinct taste for the sentient. A human could pass it to a gungan, a gammorean to a twi'lik. Insidious and slow to progress, yet nearly always fatal, the dreaded disease slipped through quarantines and health scans unnoticed, sometimes traveling within a host for months before it manifested. The culture was highly adaptable, rapidly working around any â€œcureâ€ anyone ever produced. Even those imbued with the mystical power of Fraxia could do little to stop the plague from eating away its victims, or prevent the spread of the vicious ailment, nor were the mystic any less susceptible. The Black Plague was deadly, near impossible to detect, and indiscriminate.
The Black Plague ended most strangely. A new species arrived with crippled hyper craft, limping into a known system, frightfully well armed yet cautious about using the weaponry they carried with so much familiarity. This new species, the (blank), did not understand Basic, of any other language spoken in the known galaxy, and was completely awed at the technology of the locals. Their own technology was somewhat familiar to the locals, as other species relied on bio-technology already existed in Kalium, but the particulars were strange, possessed unknown qualities, and were made of substances unknown to those of the Kalium galaxy.
To fear what they do not understand is the weakness of all sentient creatures, and the factions feared the new comers. The newcomers strange technology, abundance of weapons, and odd, fearful way they stared at everything. Fear begets hate, and hate begets war. But in a plague riddled society, there was only so few battle that could be waged before none had any strength to fight. The newcomers defended themselves, but pursued no vengeance of preemptive strikes, doing nothing to further provoke the galaxy, content on looking, touching, and exploring.
The leaders of the faction worried, assured this new species engineered the Black Plague and let it loose on the galaxy, and now were arriving to finish its work, or perhaps to see what the new homes would look like after the current owners died. That was until it was discovered the strange new species had a very proactive immune system, actively seeking out and destroying viruses and disease outside their bodies. This included the Black Plague. Further more, anyone contracting these 'hunter-killer' enzymes became their host, and the 'cure' for the Black Plague spread from survivor to survivor.
As quickly as it had come, the Black Plague was removed from the galaxy.
Of the newcomers, the (blank), many factions sought to include them into their ranks. But once a common language was established, the (blank) joined the (blank) faction, happily accepting a barren planet as their new home world, and containing to explore anything and everything they can. Others, not understanding why the (blank) took such a resource poor world as trade for their presense, asked the (blank) faction what else did they offer the newcomers. The faction merely replied â€œWe said they could live on a planet of our choosing, and we would leave them alone.â€

**Expansionism**
-2500 to -2000
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

With the shattering disease vanquished, the galaxy once again set about rebuilding itself. A resource race began, with each faction seeking to gain the lead in a galaxy, this time avoiding bloodshed. A sort of a cold war, this race, this time with resources replacing weapons, troops, or technology.
Old, forgotten worlds were given a new look, while new worlds were sought out. Great stretches of space were plotted and charted, adding to the catalog of known worlds, pushing the known galaxy farther and farther out. Hyper crafts, bigger and faster than ever before, launched into the unknown. Should rich resources be discovered, a Hyper Ring would be reorientated, providing a gateway in which a freshly built Ring sections would be gated in, ready for assembly. A few newly discovered or rediscovered planets were stripped of their resources without care, but most were merely claimed and colonized, saved to be exploited later, or carefully managed in order to provide a long term benefit.
This age ended upon the accidental discovery of the Sith, and the ensuing bloodbath.

</details>

**The Sith War (also known as the Second Intergalactic War)**
-2000 to -1500
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Hyper Craft, the Grand Design II, was said to the first ship to inadvertently hyper jump into a Sith occupied system, though the official story was that a malfunction in it's hyperdrive destroyed it before it ever came out of hyperspace. If this was the case, the Sith had some kind of mystical warning of the ship's impending arrival, so prepared as the were when the second hyper craft appeared into Du'Gual system. The Grand Design III, completely unaware of the danger, was captured with minimal damage, and its crew and passenger taken prisoners. No word of what happened made it back to the rest of the galaxy; they were unprepared for what happened next.
The prisoners were brought before the Sith Overlord, Angelica For'Limir. Edrik Carn, reappearing, began to walk anew in the shadow of the Overlord. Upon seeing these newest invaders, Edrik Carn knew exactly who they were and where they had come from. Old memories of his family filling his mind, he whispered advise into the ears of the Angelica For'Limir. Overlord Angelica, having suffered several attempts to break apart the Sith empire, would not allow another attempt, from any source. Heeding the prized advise of the first Sith Overlord, she readied her armies.
In less than a year, the Sith armies began making probing attacks into the known galaxy. The various factions accused other factions for these attacks, never expecting a threat outside their realm of knowledge. Armies were raised, and war once again threatened to engulf the factions. When they discovered the truth, it was too late.
The Sith Expedition Fleet, easily ten times the size of any currently present among the factions, conquering systems with startling speed. Moving without the aid of the Hyper Rings, they struck deep within the factions, skipping from one system to the next in a seemly random pattern, yet always hitting with unbelievable strength, always driving deeper toward the galaxy's core. They were unstoppable.
But when the Expedition Fleet entered the Ysanna system, they faltered. The hutts, attune to the same mystical powers the Sith used to guide the battle, proved not only equal to the Sith pilots and strategist, but were privy to mystical secrets unknown to the Sith. With the cunning and reliance the hutts were known for, the Sith found themselves striking at shadows, blindsided and confused. Constant reinforcements- Ysanna retinues returning home from the far corners of the galaxy- appeared from the Hyper Ring, constantly conducting raids and harassing the fleet, while Ysanna fighters- excelling in operating without reinforcement- played a deadly game of cat and mouse with the Sith on the surface. What should have been another easy battle for the Expedition Fleet became a slow, taxing conflict. The Ysanna fleet was eventually destroyed, but the hutt worlds were never fully taken.
The Expedition Fleet was under orders not to damage the Hyper Rings, as their use would be expected after the conquest of the factions. The constant Ysanna reinforcements forced the Expedition Fleet to alter their plans, making the hutt Hyper Ring a primary target (any reinforcements that jumped into the system would become trapped there). This proved to be their second mistake, as the descendants of Ara Noor stood ready for such an attempt. While the secret of turning the Ring into a weapon was long lost, constant upgrades to the Rings made them formidable targets, and, with the I-Net systems housed inside, they had unmatched communications. Targeting systems, designed to unerringly guide a ship across millions of light years of space, proved excellent in tracking moving ships within a single system. The Battle of Ysanna was one of the most painful lessons the Sith learned.
By the time the Sith had began to attack the Hyper Ring in Ysanna, the rest of the factions had finally recovered from their shock, and gathered their forces to attack. Emboldened by the heroics of the Ysanna, united by the I-Net, and incensed by the Sith attack, the factions jumped as one into the Ysanna system.
After six months of constant battle, the Expedition Fleet fled the Ysanna system, beaten in the first time in its history. The factions cheered at the retreating fleet, assured of their victory. Weeks later, having disbanded and in the beginning stages of the rebuilding, when the Expedition Fleet reappeared, returning at full strength. This time, they avoided the Ysanna system, focusing on those factions that dealt them the most damage during the previous battles. The factions once again regrouped, striking through the Hyper Rings. The Expedition Fleet retreated upon the factions' arrival, luring the fleet away. Then the second Sith Fleet appeared, and the third, each attacking different systems, different factions. The faction fleet disintegrated as each cluster retreated back o their homeworld for defense.
The Sith began to make great headway once again into the factions, even capturing several core worlds, when several things happened all at once.
The Jedi, long defenders of the Hyper Rings, began to train mystically empowered pilots, forming whole wings of supernaturally enhanced fighters. Almost single handedly, this Jedi wings would stall the Sith offensive for days at a time before retreating through the Hyper Rings.
The Sith, almost entirely united during their long history, near had a period such as the Stilled holocaust, and were complete unprepared as several 'super weapons' were reactivated. The Black Storm, ancient and archaic, was brought out of hiding, unleashing its devastating payload through the Hyper Rings, smashing huge chunks of the Sith fleets. The Shatter Zone, an EMP and Ion laced battle station, paralyzed the third Sith fleet for a full day before it was disabled and sent running through a Hyper Ring.
A small, elite unit of special operations soldiers, using captured star maps from a disabled Sith craft, jumped back to the Sith Empire to sow confusion and to cripple its Warmachine (a lofty goal, to be sure, but no faction understood the width and breath of the Sith empire at the time). Though small, the tiny group, ironically called Task Force Fraxia (TFF), brought â€œa merry hellâ€ to the Sith empire, bringing a tiny aspect of the war to the protected systems fueling the Expedition Fleets.
And, with the introduction of the TFF, and the fleets deployed, the Silent Rebels chose that moment to strike. The Sith Empire broke to pieces as groups of rebels fought with the loyalists and each other, each seeking to become the new rulers of the galaxy. Almost without knowing, the rebels fractured into factions similar to the factions their fleets fought across the galaxy. The war in the Sith systems was just as bloody as it was among the factions.
Despite all of this, the Sith were far from beaten. Fleet commanders contacted various faction members, offering portions of the galaxy- once conquered- as gifts should they assist Sith. Not all agreed, but enough did, and when the factions were once more fighting among themselves, the Expedition Fleet regrouped, and attacked once more. What supplies they could no longer expect from home- the civil war disrupting much needed supplies- they gathered from conquered worlds. The Expedition Fleet, tasked with conquering the entire galaxy in the name of the Sith, would not be stopped.
It took a five hundreds years, but in the end, the Expedition Fleet succeeded as well as anyone short of the Silver King had managed. They were no longer the Sith they once were. The civil war of the Sith homeworlds spilled into the factions, who brought their war(s) back to the Sith, intermingling until they were one in the same. Overlord Angelica For'Limir lived out her four terms, stepping down as Overlord, and was replaced by a long series of Overlords, most that survived only a single term before either stepping down or getting killed.
As the Sith empire spread further into the faction, it was forced out of its homeworlds, the various rebel groups whittling away as the edges, taking advantage of their Fleet's inability to be everywhere at once. While the empire effectively controlled the galaxy, it was a tedious hold, one that threatened to collapse at any moment. Many were just waiting for the final moment to come.

**The Harriers Return**
-1500
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Project Harriers, the last super weapon of the Age of Stilled Holocaust, reappeared fifteen hundred years ago. Ten droid factories in all, they jumped into hidden system the Sith Overlord ran his empire from. The Harriers, no longer under the control of Mother (reportedly destroyed by the Black Storm) but existing in a collective consciousness, offered their services to the Overlord. In exchange with five centuries of service, the droids demanded a system of their own. The Overlord- his exact name was debatable, as there was a rash of Overlord successions during those years- agreed, but with stiff restrictions.
True to their word, the Harriers have served the Sith for the duration, mass producing their soldiers and fighters to fight the Sith's battles while the living warriors regrouped and rested. But even the Harriers had limits, and could not bring absolute order to the galaxy, and even if they could, the Sith hardly wanted to a totalitarian rule dependent on mercenary droids. Instead, the Sith settled for a stabilized galaxy. Factions would still exist, and even their own homeworlds would still be at odds, but total war was no longer the function of the galaxy. A kind of peace could be experienced by all.
Again, true to the contract they made with the Sith, after five centuries of service, the Harriers walked away from their posts and jumped to the system they earned. Several factions has attempted to either destroy the Harriers or seize their system, and the Harriers now keep all of their factories positioned there in defense. The only soldier droids that leave the system are those mercenaries individual groups hire.

**Peace of the Sith**

The bulk of the galaxy is under Sith rule. They are impartial leaders, allowing rulers of one world to conduct their affairs as they will, as long as the taxes and levies are paid on time. As always with the Kalium galaxy, there is near any true peace, with skirmishes breaking out constantly. Various rebel groups struggle against the Sith empire. Factions still exist, far too ingrained into the weave of the galaxy to be burned out, and they still fight among themselves and with the Sith.

I don't know if droids have ever been discussed since I've been here.  I honestly can't recall a single thread where they were actively discussed.

Heh, kk. But if a droid explosion thousands of years ago was enough to push slave trade down to a minimum, droid technology would seem to be everywhere by now.
A question I forgot to ask: Are we really going the Hypergate route then? Are these like Hyperspace cannons where you shoot off in one direction to your destination or like stargates in that you need one either end? And can one engage in two way travel through a hyperspace gate?  <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Again, I figure droids were pretty common anyhow, and this just makes a historic reason for the fact.

I hate how I ended it.  I'll have to work on it.  Surely there is a better way, right?  Give me an idea how, and I'll write it up.

I was thinking that you required two gates, originally.  One at the start point, and one at the end (with hundreds or thousands in between).  However, Rowan wrote something up where only one was required; you hyper cannon idea).  So, what do yawl think?
I liek the cannon idea, honestly.  It suits the Star Wars feel of fast and uncomplicated.
As for sticking with the hyper gate idea...I would like to.  Currently, as written, hyper rings are merely cheap and easily accessed.  Other means exist, but those other means are expensive.  However, if yawl deside otherwise, we'll do some thing else.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-08 18:53:00)

I prefer to use only one gate/cannon/whatever for travel.  Two sets up far more problems than it is ever worth, especially if we don't want to use regular hyperdrives as the main method of transportation.  If two were needed, it would take longer than Breeder's entire history just to place the gates past the Core Worlds.  With just one, you could open up so many more possibilities for stories.
As for the Sith, well, I don't mind them being major players, but if they are going to be the guys in charge, I'm going to have to re-work the Ysanna a bit.  As I have them written, they are a galactic peace-keeping force.  Now the Sith might not mind using their harsh ways to exert control over the galaxy, but the Ysanna are not going to operate under anyone's control but their own.  They Ysanna believe they're right and everyone else is wrong and they'll kill you if you disagree.  They'd become more of a strong rebellious faction fighting the Sith . . . which really is not a bad idea, come to think of it.

<span style="font-size: 1.40em;">**Part One**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hyperspace was a dangerous place in those days.  Without any sort of safeguards, ships were routinely lost to gravity wells and some simply never emerged from hyperspace.  One out of every hundred ships was lost.
The people of the galaxy were frustrated by the difficulties of interstellar travel, and many refused to use it at all.  Interstellar communication existed through a Holonet, but many were not satisfied by merely seeing the planets.  They wanted to go, but they wanted it to be safe.
On top of that, many consular ships had vanished, and the governments would cry "Sabotage!" every time one did.  Indeed, many were sabotaged, but who could tell if there was no wreck and no evidence?  Peace among the worlds was not something anyone could grasp.  How could there be peace when there was no reliable travel?
Then, a scientist/politician by the name of Marcus Tain called together a meeting of the worlds.  The meeting--once all of the ambassadors arrived--was the first recorded account of a summit that did not end in bloodshed.  There, Tain brought forth an idea: Hyperspace Rings.  These Rings allowed much faster and much safer interstellar travel by opening a gateway directly to hyperspace.
Tain was elected to spearhead the development of the Rings, and the entire project was under his control.  The Rings required massive resources to build, resources that were only available on a handful of worlds.  The ones that did not have the resources were expected to provide the labor to build them. 
Contractors started a bidding war over the Rings, trying to get themselves a lifetime of work and a steady income.  Espionage--and even outright physical attacks--resulted.  Smaller contractors were crushed by the large corporations, soon only leaving four companies left to build the rings, all of them based on the world of Hyperis.
Hyperis, which did not have any of the resources needed for the rings, had a very rich population.  They did not want to have their people reduced to a life of hard labor, so they brought in others to do their share of the work--the poor citizens of Firaxia, who were already contributing massive resources for the undertaking.  The leaders of the summit knew what Hyperis was doing, but did not stop them, since the world had the contractors who were building the rings.  As far as they were concerned, Hyperis could get its labor wherever they wanted.
Many citizens who knew what was happening protested Hyperis's actions, especially its treatment of the Firaxians.  Countless setbacks occurred as the protesters turned to coordinated attacks to accomplish their goals.  Corporation headquarters on Hyperis were bombed, their foremen were assassinated, and countless other crimes were committed against them.  Hundred of innocent workers were killed by collateral damage.
Marcus Tain came forward with a public speech, one that rallied the dissenters to his side by condemning Hyperis's actions.  Of course, he continued to support their labor practices behind the scenes, determined to see his project to completion. 
He called for the ten known worlds to unite in a Galactic Protectorate (GP), a new entity that would ensure the rings and the workers were protected.  The attacks stopped for awhile when Hyperis became more careful about how they "recruited" their workers.  The GP established its own paramilitary force, one with the sole duty of insuring the Rings were completed, by any means necessary.
Then, suddenly, the attacks resumed again, and in full force.  The GP launched an investigation into it, and found that many of the aggressors had originated on Firaxia.  A deeper investigation uncovered that these Firaxians possessed a power over their mind and body that had never been seen before, a power written within their very DNA and one they called the Force.  When these findings were released to the public, it nearly created mass hysteria and panic as people became fearful of these "wizards. "
The GP blockaded the world and rounded up its people, performing genetic tests on every Firaxian.  They were shocked to find that it wasn't only the Humans who had this power, but the Zabrak, the Duros, the Ithorians--any species could become one of these wizards.  Anyone and everyone found to have the genes was rounded up and imprisoned within internment camps.  This started the first of the Gene Wars, where anyone could imprisoned purely because they possessed a certain genetic code.
For fifteen long years this war raged, as worlds tried to protect their wizards from persecution and the GP stomped right in and arrested them and their co-conspirators.
This was the first war since the formation of the GP, and it was a brutal one.  The GP enacted martial law on all planets and had no mercy on anyone they found to be aiding the Force-users.
While, at first, these Force wizards were not particularly strong in their abilities, they learned quickly.  Soon they were mastering abilities like levitation and healing, making their side ever stronger.  However, they were still no match for the might of the GP.  Order was restored to the Core worlds, at least for awhile, after the last of the Force-users was imprisoned.
Marcus Tain died the day the first ring was completed above Hyperis.  He never got a chance to see his dream in action.  His successor, Tornik Scraf, made a speech to the unified worlds, and promised to continue his predecessor's work.
It was after this speech that Firaxia rebelled, starting the second of the Gene Wars.  The conflict that ensued was brutal and thousands upon thousands of Firaxians were killed.  Others were forced into hiding as they tried to outrun the GP.  Thousands more were placed in prison camps with their Force-using brethren.
The Force-users had been biding their time, waiting until the moment was right to use their powers and free themselves.  Together they rebelled and managed to steal several dreadnaughts, new ones still in the spacedock.  They escaped through one of the completed Hyperspace Rings, fleeing into the far reaches of the Outer Rim, as far from the GP as they could go.
The GP covered up this story, as Scraf announced that the Dreadnaughts were destroyed by the GP Navy.  And so it was that the second of the Gene Wars came to an end.

One century later, the Firaxians who'd fled the Gene Wars had settled on a small world in the Crux system, Agansti, and were rebuilding the civilization they'd lost.  Several years into the reconstruction, a small ship--no more than a starfighter--crashed outside their capital.
Inside was an injured Edrik Carn, Sith apprentice.  His people had just discovered the hyperdrive, though a remarkably unreliable one.  He'd been chosen as a test pilot by his master, but the flight did not go as planned when he got too close to a gravity well in the Crux system.
As he recuperated in the Firaxian hospitals, Carn gave the plans to his ship to the Firaxians, as well as those for larger and more dangerous ships.  He manipulated his way into a position of power, calling himself Darth Taral, Sith Lord, though he had yet to finish his training.
As the years passed the hatred taught by Carn reached its peak and the Firaxian people, under the leadership of the Sith Lord begin to prepare for retribution. The Core worlds that shunned them would fall to their might, and to the true master of the galaxy, Darth Taral.

Three centuries after the completion of the first rings, the GP has become nothing more than a group of thugs, albeit very powerful thugs.  Their central duty was to protect the Core worlds and their rings, much to the dismay of the colonies that had sprung up, and were now left at the mercy of pirates who could hijack the rings for their own purposes.
During a test of a newer, faster Hyperspace Ring, a GP ship was mysteriously destroyed and the Ring damaged.  An investigation into it found the Ring to be faulty when it open prematurely, destroying the ship.  It truth, it was a bombing attack run by a Sith ship, testing the defenses of the GP.
The Sith Empire in the Outer Rim had extended far beyond just the world of Agansti, encompassing dozens of worlds.  Darth Taral, still alive after all these years, had been expanding, planning, waiting for the day when he could take the fight to the GP.  For the Agansti, it was a chance to avenge their loss three centuries previously.  For Taral, it was simply a chance to rule the galaxy.
The Sith also stole the plans to the new Hyperspace Ring, intending to build one of their own to move their fleets into the Core, instead of the unreliable hyperdrive the bomber had been using.
When the ring was complete, they were finally ready.  Their soldiers were eager to begin the fight with the despised GP.
The Core was about to fall.

<span style="font-size: 1.40em;">**Part Four**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

When the Sith attacked, it was without warning.  One-by-one the Core worlds fell to the overwhelming assault.  The Sith made it a point to destroy the Hyperspace Rings of the GP, making the war effort all but impossible for them.  They were forced to rely on their old hyperdrives.
The Galactic Protectorate tried to fight against those overwhelming odds, but every battle was a loss for them.  After a devastating loss at the Third Battle of Tinn, a Jedi fighter squadron arrived in the galaxy under the leadership of Master Ara Noor.  She met with Galactic Protectorate officials, but was disheartened by their corruption and did not join them to fight the Sith.
On her way out of the Core, she stopped at the planet New Moncada to refuel and resupply. She witnessed a young woman attempting to rally others to stand together and fight the Sith. Noor was inspired to see someone so idealistic and approached her, to join her in fighting the Sith. With Noor's help, the young woman, Kaitlyn Zarell managed to convince many people from New Moncada, Bandor, Fothayn, and even the Zabrak colonies to unite in Zarelle's Coalition, as it has come to be known.
Elsewhere, the Bendu Monks, seeing the devastation caused by these dark-siders, openly began attacking the Sith whenever and wherever they could.  The Psylan took heart from seeing that someone was resisting and contacted their allies, the Ysanna, an organization that had been content to police their corner of the galaxy.  Seeing the Sith without order and justice spurred on the Ysanna, and they came in fighting.  What's more, they had a reliable hyperdrive, which they shared with the Coalition and anyone who was willing to fight the Sith.
Through a daring raid, the Coalition managed to get their hands on the coordinates of the capital of the Sith Empire, Agansti.  Using the Ysanna hyper drives, the Coalition sent in a small but powerful force to do whatever they could to destroy the Sith industry.  The warriors sent in knew it was likely a suicide mission, and one that they would never return from.
The fighting force, led by one of the Ysanna High Lords, wreaked havoc on the Sith home for years before the last of them were caught.  They'd done their job, and the Sith were having trouble sending in any reinforcements.
Several rebel factions within the Sith Empire seized the chance the Coalition had provided them and fought back against their oppressors.  Though they were no match for the experience of the Sith Army, they did significant damage and stalled the Sith for years more than the Coalition had before they were finally defeated.
Back in the Core, the war was still raging and did so for a few more years.  Ever so slowly the Sith were beaten back.  When the Ysanna brought in the *Obsidian Sky*, their flagship, the united worlds faced down the Sith in a final, climactic battle over Firaxia.  The combined forces of the Coalition, the Bendu, the Psylan, and the Ysanna destroyed the majority of the Sith Fleet.
The remaining Sith fled to the Outer Rim, only to begin planning once again.  They may have been beaten this time, but it would not happen again.  When they next attacked, they would win.  There was no doubt.
Back in the Core, the worlds were lining up under the banner of the Coalition.  The Core worlds eagerly joined up, desperately seeking the peace that had eluded them for so many years.  The GP was no more.
Some, though, were not so eager.  The Ysanna wanted the galaxy to follow them, believing that only through their order could they beat back the Sith, should they ever return.  Other governments sprung up, each with their own agenda, and a fractured galaxy was born.

Please. I beg of you. Consular. Not counsellor. That's as horrific a transgression as rouge.
Otherwise it sounds alright actually. Once of my peeves with breeder's version is that multiple details like Centrepoint, multiple sith wars and ending with a Sith dominant galaxy parallel GFFA too closely. The present day there sounds a lot like the Galactic Empire, the Sith-Imperial empire and even echoes The Old Republic's setting some.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-09 19:01:12)

I can't believe I did that.  That's embarrassing.  Where's the smiley smacking his head on a wall when you need one? 
But, if that's the biggest issue you have with my history, I'll take it.  That was the biggest thing, wasn't it?  Please?
But, honestly, are their any things that don't sit right?  It's easy enough to fix.  I know Breeder had pointed some stuff out before, so there's got to be something.

### **Thraken** (2009-02-09 20:06:09)

Okay. Where the hell did the Jedi come from and where did they get a fighter squadron that can zip around the galaxy as they please?
If one measly apprentice sith created a sith empire that mashed most of the galaxy, where are the rest of the sith?
Are they a 'True Sith' empire that is going to sweep upon the galaxy Yuuzhan Vong style and thus all us players become high level heroes in our created factions and wage an EPIX campaign to fight off these bad bad invaders? (ooh, that's good)
As for any other issues - It's like Star Wars and Star Trek. Star Trek has got decades of material to nitpick it to death. Star Wars is a bunch of movies and then all the fans and writers fill in absolutely everything else. You get me?  <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-09 20:35:09)

Actually, I have no idea where they came from.  How the Jedi exist in Kalium hasn't really been decided.  I know they're not supposed to be the one-big Force organization, as the galaxy was going to have lots to all share the spotlight.  But beyond that, I don't what, if anything, has been decided about them.  I wasn't going to make too many assumptions with the history, so I just kinda threw them in there.  Whenever we decide what to do with them, I can alter the history accordingly.  I know it does seem kinda forced at the moment, but I can't fix it until I know what I'm doing with the Jedi.
The Sith Empire, however, is a different story.  SacredPhoenix and I were discussing them and he was going to post something on them in factions.  That was back in November, and I haven't seen him around these boards in over a month, so I wouldn't count on it happening anytime soon.  From what I remember, it was going to be a big empire on one side of the galaxy that was slowly expanding with plans to invade the rest of the galaxy.  So, yeah, sorta like you said.

### **Thraken** (2009-02-09 20:49:41)

schweet - spamming the Mass Combat rules here we come XD
Well. I wasn't sure where to broach the subject - but the history of the universe thread is as good a place as any:
How exactly does Kalium approvals work? I mean there's plenty of talk about starship creation rule only ships, hyperdrive restrictions, hyperspace cannons etc. but nothing's been nailed down and stated - yes this is what we're going with. Without any visible rubber stamping or approvals process to set the rules of this galaxy - how do we push worth laying down content?  ???

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-09 21:18:40)

That's a good question . . . but one that I don't have the answer to.  It's something I've been wondering lately.  Most of what has been nailed down was decided before I got here.  It's seems to be just agreed on by general consensus (like the starship rules), but I think what we really need is a thread to keep track of these things.  If we put a list in the top post of all the stuff that's been agreed on and use the rest of the thread to argue about it, it might make things easier.  Then we can ask whatever we want about the little details.  Is that about what you were looking for?

---

### **Thraken** (2009-02-10 09:29:25)

Aye, just an agreed set of rules that this galaxy is pegged to and we can build on.
I would have suggested a poll regarding certain things and if it's approved past a benchmark number of people then can pin it somewhere saying 'this is what we're going with'
I think we could also abduct Rowen for his opinion on proceedings  ;D

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-05 21:28:54)

And now, mine if (slightly) more condensed.
So, what are our thoughts on the time line? There are a couple different timelines posted; what are we going to do with them? Pick one? Merge them? Scrap them all and come up with new stuff?
I did notice I put a lot more into mine than others did. More doesn't mean better, I know. But, if everyone (or most of everyone) likes Rowan's or some one elses better, I could take the time to expand on it, make it fuller.
So, what do we want to do?

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-05 21:51:26)

There were some problems I had with you timeline (most notably the Sith), but I've been too busy to go over it with the attention it deserves. Heck, I've been wanting to expand mine a little, but can't get to it.
I wouldn't mind combining the two. Originally, when I posted my revision, I was going to do that, but I barely got started on it. In another week or so, I'll have time to really go into it if you want to wait and see what I do.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-06 16:57:49)

Tell ya what, I'll work on that, the combining or expanding yours, and we'll see where that goes.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-06 17:21:50)

Go ahead. That'll make things a lot easier for me.
There were two major issues I had with your history, and I'll get them out so you can at least think about them. One, I hated that the Sith controlled most of the galaxy. That kinda took away from the fractured galaxy thing. In my mind, they should just be another faction vying for control of the galaxy.
Two, you didn't really pay attention to the material that had already been submitted to the galaxy and so contradicted it in your history (like renaming planets and ignoring some factions). While it's not a huge deal, writing the history to fit the galaxy is better than rewriting everything else to fit the history. (I know that, for the sake of story, that contradictions are bound to happen, but it's better to at least *try* and avoid them.)

That's okay. I hated the Sith part, as well. I have noticed that both our histories focused a lot on a two sided battle. That, for me, is way to easy to be part of Kalium. It's not just Black & White, but grey, blue, and red, and a lot of other colors (but no orange, because orange is hideous). So, as I play with your history, I will strive to muddle the sides, and make conflicts involve multiple sides.
And yeah, I hated how I ended my timeline. I was tied, and was really hoping some one else who fix it. I'm lazy like that.
> **MoDaVader wrote:**

I made two mistakes here, and I'm glad you brought them to my attention. Yep, I ignored the factions, planets, etc that already existed. This was done because I wasn't sure how, when, and where the authors of those factions & planets wanted to be put in. And it was easier to write the history and expect everyone else to adjust to what I wrote. Some days I'm lazy and rude. Shocking, I know, but hey, I'm only (super) human.
And humble.
The second mistake I made was not to state the Red Pen Rule. I intended for faction authors and planet authors, and all that to chime in and say they wanted their names here or there, or they wanted this added for their creation, or that deleted because it conflicted with what they wanted. As it stands, what I wrote I slapped on the table, and made it sound like this was the end all be all. I didn't mean to present that image, but everyone knows the phrase dealing with hell and what it's paved with.

Good stories don't contradict themselves. A place for everything and everything in its place. Remember, fiction has to make sense. Reality doesn't. If there are contradictions, tell me, and I'll fix them. Or we'll fix them.

I think maybe I wasn't clear here. What I meant was that the history might contradict the material because the material wasn't written with a story in mind and so everything might not fit together. So, the story (the history, in this case), might contradict what was already written when several things didn't end up working together. But, yeah, you got it.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-10 14:33:20)

I got to working on the "New and Even More Improved!" timeline, and suddenly, I had an idea.
Boy, it hurt.
For osme reason, I started the galaxy off as slave aboard giant (small moon sized) black ships, locked in cages by mysterious and faceless creatures call Keepers. The Keepers would direct their Dark Fleet across the galaxy, stopping at a planet just long enough to strip it of natural resources and near intelligent life before moving on. The slaves did thousands of tasks on the ship, unknowingly keep the ship in working order. Some were used as technicians, some mechanics, some grew food or tended the oxygen producing trees, some hunted for escaped slaves, some acted as secret police, and others acted as brutal law enforcement (such as it was).
Some parts of the ship were underwater, some were in methane flooded rooms, etc, so every species could be on every Black Ship.
One day, the Keepers disappeared. Within weeks to centuries (depending on which Black Ship you were talking about) the ships crashed on one planet or another. The species got out (if they could survive in that atmosphere) and began life as we know it.
Centuries later, the Black Ships suddenly came back alive and took off, never to be seen again.
Then, after I was done with that portion, I fgured that not everyone might like it, so I am posting up the idea here. At least this way, I won't waste a lot of time if yawl don't like it.
So...whatcha think?

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-10 15:21:14)

Well, it's not really how I was thinking, but . . . I dunno. I think I may prefer that we leave that part out. It doesn't seem Star Wars-y enough to me. I'll think about it.

I think he's referring to the [Rakata](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rakata "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rakata") and their [Infinite Empire](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Empire "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Empire"). I don't know of any actual Rakatan Empire (though I could be mistaken).

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-25 15:29:03)

Op-tempo picked up. Little busy.
Still working on the timeline. I'm looking for something that catches, something different than before yet pulls from what we already have. So far...not much. Once something does catch, it should be quick, but...
Well, chime in with some ideas if you have something. I'm trying to get multiple sides to nearly every event. I believe that is what we are going for right? Not just the Empire and the Rebellion, the Jedi and the Sith, but at least six major force traditions and many factions. Right?
I will say that every major event we as a planet have had had two sides, so that makes it tough. Foe us Americans, we had the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the World Wars, etc. All, even the World Wars, had two sides. Making this multiple side thing isn't easy.
But, I'll manage. Yawl take care.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-19 13:00:42)

Thinking on it, we don't even have a proper galactic history yet, though much of what's posted references it.
Should we just go with it and strip out stuff like the hypergates for our current stuff?
Also - the whole Sith Galactic Empire thing is kinda stale...

### **Rebaav** (2009-10-19 16:38:16)

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-19 17:24:44)

There are Sith, but the write-up never appeared on the site. The only person who has them is no longer present here.
I was always under the impression that the galaxy was supposed to be fractured--no one government was supposed to be in control. Under one history that I wrote, the Sith did control the galaxy at one point, but then the people rebelled, won, and then started infighting, creating the fractured galaxy. The Sith exist, but they were relegated to their own little corner of it.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-10-19 17:35:51)

Huh, ok. The last entry in the first post said differently :P

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-19 17:48:15)

Well, that's why it's up there, so we can debate it. about halfway down that first page is my own version of the history, modified from Rowen's original version to include other information that had been written up for the site (species, worlds,factions, etc.). It doesn't end with the Sith controlling the galaxy (and yes, I am unabashedly plugging my own writing).

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-20 01:53:35)

Ho hum.
I went with the first version presented when developing the background of the Force organisations I submitted. I was surprised that the Sith had such a big role but hey, you work with what you're given.

Yeah, now that my memory has been retrieved I still stand by my support for the more streamlined and generally open for development version.

The biggest problem with Breeder's history was that it ignored all the other info that had been developed for Kalium: planets, species, factions. The Ysanna, for example, don't really work in a galaxy under control of one faction (unless they're that faction). I can change things, if needed, but I was never immensely fond of that history, anyway. If we go with Breeder's, though, I'll suck it up and change things.
If we go with mine, the good news is that your traditions can fit with minimal changes. Same if we develop another history altogether (as long as it considers current material, I'll be okay with it).

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-10-21 08:57:13)

Finally got around to reading the backlog of this thread.
Since Breeder is working on a new version, I won't bother commenting on his past timeline overmuch (except the bits I remember and liked) and just thank my lucky stars I didn't have to read all of it.
So that leaves MoDa's.
*stretches arms with interlocked hands, cracking the knuckles*
In general terms, I agree with Thraken. The fact your version is streamlined is a good thing. However, the more I read the more I realised it isn't "streamlined" so much as "sparse". What I mean by this is a general negligence in explaining how two and two have managed to equal four.
The really big offender here is the inclusion of Force traditions. I understand that you didn't want to tinker with other people's Force groups, but the timeline simply doesn't work as it is without some of that vital information. Where do the Sith come from? How were the Bendu, Psylans ET AL created and able to thrive when the Galaxy is under the thumb of the Force-hating GP and all the known Force users are off in the outer rim busy learning to be the Nu Sith?
I guess what I'm driving at here, is that the bits of the timeline that require tremendous leaps of logic and someone to come along and fill in the blanks should be scrapped in favour of completing that part of the puzzle when we have an entire piece to slot in. In my opinion it is both harder and more contrived to design material and force it to fit the timeline events you've created than it would be to organically design timeline events to fit the material itself.
And while we're cutting back the dead branches to give the live ones a chance to grow, I may as well put in my two cents on what I liked and disliked:
Personally, I would prefer Marcus Tain to play a bigger role. Perhaps he doesn't need to be quite as epic as in Breeder's version, but I do think Breeder is closer to an ideal in this area. In general I prefer the idea of Tain as a warlord than a scientist and I also think his forcefully uniting a fractured Galaxy, even if only briefly, opens up entire vistas for development. The worlds he conquered, the edicts he made, the good and the bad of his actions, and even the tensions he created or resolved could help shape the history to come after, and be the genesis for entire cultures, organisations (such as my Abo'eth), and even technologies.

---

I'm not a big fan of the way the Force users are discovered and subsequently treated. Maybe it's the fact it reminded me too much of the way mutants are treated in X-men. Although treating the Force as a mutation rather than a mystic power or *cough*midichlorians*cough* could be interesting if done well.

---

I do like the GP though. They're like the Sith rule of Breeder's, but more interesting because they're a new faction.

---

This is so minor, but I have to say it: I kinda hate the name "Gene Wars". I don't have a better alternative right now, but... I know it's common practice to name a war after the thing it was about, but Gene Wars doesn't sound either cool or ominous to me, which makes what would otherwise be a potentially fascinating period of history into a mere dull footnote.

---

I'm going to go ahead and join the "Why are the Sith so important?" camp. I have absolutely nothing against the Sith being a part of the Kalium Galaxy - we're trying to build an alternative Star Wars setting, not an alternative sci-fi setting altogether. Their inclusion definitely needs to be less obtrusive, since we want room to tell more unique stories. At the same time, it would be a mistake to complete shunt the Sith aside... maybe they could be a powerful or at least significant faction in completely new ways - and if that particular ball has been dropped I wouldn't mind a chance to put it in the air again.

---

Same with the Jedi. Anyone working on that side of things?

---

The Coalition... hm, well as I said I was liking the GP, but now they're no more. Perhaps we could end the Kalium timeline in a period of time where the GP still has some power, instead? Maybe not an outright rule, as that would be too much like the Empire. Perhaps what were once the pride of the Galaxy turned first into thugs and bullies and finally have become pirates and terrorists, taking out their futile revenge against the worlds that overthrew them? They would make very fitting rivals and enemies for the Ysanna.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-10-27 19:49:02)

I'm not complete, but I'm going to post what I have, maybe get some new insight and get provoked in to finishing:
I tired to keep it as general as possible, using "Blank #" this or "Exile #" for that, and folks could fill in where they wanted. Nothing is set in stone, and everyone is encouraged to make adjustments/re-writes/cut out on anything and everything.
And some of the entries, especially the unfinished half, has little snippets of things I was planning, but never put in.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Timeline Mark 5**</span>
Part One
Confederacy of United System <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**First Contact**
-25,000
Though there is some argument exactly which species were the first to make First Contact, it is widely accepted that the *blank faction* was the first to join peacefully. The *blank, blank*, and *blank species* were testing their first hyperdrive ships, and all jumped to the *blank system* within days of one another, stumbling upon the blank species as they were taking their first steps into space. The next few years were filled with tense negotiations, and the threat of the first inter-system war was always on the horizon. However, the species managed to adapt to each other’s differences, and they avoid open warfare.
Through trade and scientific agreements, the members of the emerging faction pooled their resources and technology, to the benefit of all involved. This would not be the norm of the galaxy.
**Awakening of the Force**

It took hundreds of years before the species of the blank to achieve full integration of one another. Their border did eventually drop, and they societies slowly integrated. Well after this intermingling of the cultures began, the religions began to mix. The monks, shamans and priests of these religions found common ground in their quests. The exchange of ideas was slow, but eventually the culmination of the exercise brought new understanding. This understanding was the beginning of the Force.
The combination of the various religions was the first Force Tradition, the *Blank 1*.
**Border Wars**
-23,000
Two thousand years after First Contact, the *blank faction* made contact with their next nearest neighbor, and was immediately fired upon. Other species had made contact with other species, and these meetings did not progress nearly as well as the *blank faction*. In fact, the new faction discovered that other species existed in every direction, and they were all fighting with someone. Some species managed to make alliances similar to the blank faction, but all this did was cause their opponents to seek allies of their own.
This was a frightful time in the galaxy, and one of rapid shifts in balance. Alliances were formed and broken, when each new species discovered was a possible threat or a resource to be used for their war machines. Travel was hazardous, yet more resources were required for power the various war machines, leading to experimental space travel.
It was clear that the galaxy was headed into self destruction.
**Quelling of the Wars**
-22,000
The *blank Tradition*, owing to their greater connection to the life threads of the galaxy, was very aware of the impending doom the galaxy faced. Choosing not to stand by and allow the galaxy to die around them, the *blank Tradition* sought out a proper instrument in which to bring order to the galaxy, or at least lessen the destruction the battles were fought. The Force Users discovered many uses for the Force in their travels, and many grew addicted to the heady power that comes with its use. Enough kept close to the monk like discipline that their goal was never compromised.
The *blank Tradition* found their vessel of order in under the name of Confederacy of United System (COUS). COUS, at the time a small faction located at the edge of known space, was a fair and impartial form of inter-system government that kept the members from warring with each other, yet allowed each participant to develop as they saw fit. Far from a perfect government, it managed to keep the violence between its very different members to a minimum.
The Force Users convinced the COUS to expand their faction of encompass other factions, subtly yet liberally using their powers to achieve their goal. The process took over three hundred years, but end the end, the galaxy was…not united, but no longer in all out war.
**The Exile**
-21,000
Members of the **blank Tradition** did not receive any credit for the lull in violence, and some chaffed under the slight. Others had grown addicted to the power the Force gave them. Still others were overcome with the sensations immersion in the Force gave them. No matter the reason, the bulk of the Force Users tied to the *blank Tradition* found themselves on what is now known as the Dark Side, though the concept of the dual side of the Force had yet to be discovered.
One Force User saw his companions suffer from rapid and terrible personality changes to more they touched the Force, and made the obvious conclusion. Tempered by the good that the Force has brought about, he strove to insure he and his students did not succumb to the darkness dwelling in his peers. He would develop the technique of drawing upon the Force through an object- such as a prepared crystal, or a strong mental contruct- in order to avoid the darker aspects of the Force.
But when the Force User attempted to show his peers this new technique- and worse, insist they follow it- he and his followers were exiled, with threats of death if they were ever seen again. Thus the Exile left the order with his small group of followers. He would found another order, focusing much more on discipline and controlled use of the Force through secondary objects such as crystals and other precious materials. This would be the first of the many.

Part Two
The Republic<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Formation of the Republic**
-20,000
As the galaxy began to solidify, it outgrew the solidarity the COUS provided. Individual factions were on the verge of ignoring the agreements that bound the COUS. Already the skirmishes between factions were increasing, and the simple government was bending under the weight of the disturbances. The call for a stronger government, with its own military, grew every year.
The decision to form a Republic was decided on *blank date*, yet it took another 100 years of deliberation before it was finalized. The Republic of Free Worlds (commonly referred to as merely the Republic) was controlled by a parliament with a representative from each colonized system, and controlled a military force (or law enforcement branch, depending on how you looked at it) composed of every represented race.
It didn’t look like a disaster, at the time.
**Manipulation of the Republic**
-19,000
The *blank Tradition*, by now spread throughout the galaxy and with representatives in almost every species, saw the Republic as the perfect tool in which to bring the galaxy under their more ‘enlightened’ control, and quickly moved to take the reins of the new government. They used their powers to take over seats in the house, or to control them from behind the scenes. They brought their powers of foresight to guide the parliament making decisions to maintain stability across the known galaxy.
But the *blank Tradition* also brought their rivalries to the Parliament, and petty squabbles quickly became intergalactic friction. Violence between members of the blank Tradition was forbidden, but not between those they influenced. This quickly led to hidden skirmishes and deadly political maneuvering. It was said the fastest way to get an obituary was to run for Parliament.
Despite the tremors caused by the infighting, the Republic kept a solid surface for the first thousand years.
**The Second Generation of the Force**
-18,000
Descendants of the Exile and his followers continued to teach their traditions, and the *Exile Tradition* grew. The *Exile 1* mirrored the *Blank Tradition* in accepting member from all species and every faction, but was decidedly bent on maintaining discipline, never touching the force without their buffering crystals. The Exile’s teaching drastically opposed to the *Blank Tradition’s* methods of influencing other, maintaining that interfering with another’s free thought as the greatest of sins. However, the *Exile 1* never moved to stop the Blank Tradition from their increasing number of blatant manipulations. Many began to wonder why.
The *Exile 1* became split along the need to interfere with the *Blank Traditions* actions, and those maintaining status quo. When seers began to predict a horrifying event in the near future, the arguments became even more dire. When two factions clashed in the Blank system and the destruction of both fleets wiped all life from the *Blank planet* and crippling the neutral faction, the sides were drawn.
Those who sought direct action against the *Blank Tradition* broke form their parent, immediately seeking to halt anymore destruction. They would form the *Exile 2*.
**Expansionism and the Clone Surge**
-17,000
Mundane politicians proved to be even more hazardous to the Republic than the Force Users
One of the largest loops holes in the Parliament was the how each faction gained or lost a seat. At first, each system got a single vote, not matter the wealth, population or military power of that system. This lead to factions placing a small colony (sometimes with a population as low as a dozen individuals) and claiming it as another inhabited system. The parliament- more specifically, those who were ‘losing’ votes to this tactics, eventually had the mandate changed, requiring a system to have at least a hundred thousand resident citizens before it was granted a vote. While this ruling favored those species with high birth rates, it proved to be an effective balance between allowing expansion and maintaining fairness.
Then a breakthrough in science made this mandate a political nightmare. Cloning- the process of creating a sentient creature in an artificial womb- became comparable in expense as natural birth. With an easy method of mass producing citizens, and rapidly aging the children to adulthood, population rates soared. Within a matter of decades factions double and tripled in size, gaining more and more clot in the Parliament. By the time the other factions discovered what was happening, the cloned factions had enough votes to stop any attempt to stop the mass cloning.
The only good thing that became of this exploitation of a political loop hole was the rapid expansion of known space. Without governments funding massive clone populations and the colonies they resided on, the galaxy would be one tenth its current size.
**Rise of the Dark-Siders**
-16,000
With the Republic growing at an astronomical rate, the *Blank Tradition* began to worry. The number of Force Users to mundane citizens was always low, but never was the ratio as large as it was then. At this time, their influence over certain members of the Republic senators was well known, yet few argued. A Force Users, especially those of the *Blank Tradition*, were seen as untouchable, undefeatable. What they could not avoid with these powers, they could foresee. Any attempt to curtail their influence was destined to fail. Corruption began to rot the galaxy.
At least, until the attack on the Blank Tradition embassy, in the blank system. There, five hundred troops broke through the gates, battered their way through the doors, and killed all of the Force Users in the embassy. Though most of the attackers were killed, it was proven that almost all were clones. The implications shook the galaxy. Not only was the Force User truly mortal, but every government had the means to defeat them.
This attack was followed by others, with varied results. The *Exile 2* stepped up their agenda, finally seeking permanent means to remove the *Blank Tradition*. With their invulnerability shattered, the Blank Tradition suffered heavily. With both mundane and *Exile 2* attacking them from every angle, even their vault powers failed to keep them ahead of the assassins.
Under the stress of the attacks, the Blank Tradition split, forming *Blank 2*. *Blank 2* retreated from politics, taking a subtler method of control while hoping their removal from the spotlight would lessen the chances of attacks. By the end of the time period, the Blank Tradition stood on equal ground with every other faction, and the *Exile 2* had gathered enough power and unity that they too rivaled the factions in strength.

The Empire<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Fall of the Republic**
-15,000
In response to their dwindling power, the Blank Tradition resorted to draconian methods for control. They stepped out of the shadows and exercised direct control over the Parliament. They sent their warriors with the Republic Fleet to squash dissidents. Aid supplies were halted as displays of power. Laws were changed to suit the supporters of the Force Users and to punish those who dared to complain. Instead of solidifying their control and destroying a rebellion, the *Blank Tradition* instead gave that rebellion fertile ground in which to grow.
The worst threat to the *Blank Tradition* came not from its attackers, but from each other. Many saw their boat sinking, and moved to secure as much power as they could before the Republic’s expected collapse. Various systems were always more valuable to the Republic- for their support of the Republic, their resources, manufacturing plants, their high Force User population, and other strategic reasons- and the Blank Tradition fought each other for control over those resources- politically, financially, shadowy wars, and outright violence. Ancient feuds blossomed as the long held grudges found convenient excuses. Pass slights- real and imagined- leaped from sore points to causes of war.
The Republic shattered in an eruption of war, splintering in a brutal symphony of destruction, blood, and death.
