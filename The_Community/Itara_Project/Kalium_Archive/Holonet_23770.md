It's very quiet in Kalium.... >.>
Anyways, I in one of my megalomaniacal moods wondered if there was any equivalent of the Holonet in Kalium. If not, I haves a plan for at least a partial network based out of my mini empire that I building over in the faction discussion.

So I've noticed.  I'm working on my galactic map, trying to define government borders.  I was hoping if I had something to show, someone might be inspired by the empty space to make a government and it would get this boulder moving again.

There is probably something very similar in the galaxy.  Like the galaxy, though, it's probably a very fractured system.  Each government probably has their own version of it with its own quirks.
That got me thinking.  I think we need to come up with some standard sheet to represent governments.  You know, something like the planets have, but specifically designed for the different factions, so we can include all the necessary info in an easy-to-read format.  I'll see if I can come up with something.

That'd be so useful. My uber government is a mess in a post.
My idea for at least part of a holonet is that some rich entrepeneur buys a bunch of surplus ships with Holonet transceivers from my government and runs it as a public Holonet service and all.
Given the limited number of transceivers it wouldn't be as powerful as star wars holonet, but it'd be a working galactically accessible network.
I want them to be based off the BBC, thus they like reporting everything from anywhere. could be a nice place to announce some dodgy happenings in the galaxy.

I listed one idea in one of my history entries, alas they are currently lost in the depths of the internet.
Holonet in the Lucas-verse, as far as I can tell, was a galactic wide web of satellites.  A means of communications.  If we are using the Hyper Ring idea, they make great replacements for the satellites, along with cheap and easy hyperspace.
As for the news broadcast idea:  Go for it.  I would vote for something closer to what we have today, instead of a single new company.  Make three or four big news networks, each fighting for the top ratings, and each reporting in a way that hints at a hidden agenda.  You could have a game based around a bunch of reporters trying to out do the other stations, save the universe, and conduct corporate espionage all at the same time.

Indeed, anyone with the resources could do such a network - which is why I'm only talking about a group spawned from my little empire :P
I'm basing mine off the BBC with its pervasive spread and impartiality. I'm sure you people could come up with all sorts of things. Like basing a network off the Iraqi information minister  <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I think he was auditioning for a job at CNN...
I am really liking the idea of the media wars. Not so much as playing a reporter, but the effects of having a million news bodies running around, looking for the next big story. Your bounty hunter may just pick up a few trails, himself, looking to watch him bag his next job.
