Just curious on this whole Kallium thing.
Could we get a sit-rep complete with thread links to the various "distinguishing characteristics" (vs Gallaxy Far Far Away) discussions from the coordinating entities (mod in charge)?
Thanks.
ps: Could this be moved, please, out of the Technology & into the generic "Kalium Galaxy". Thanks & sorry about that.

Moved. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
As for what's happening with Kalium, I don't know. I would like to see it keep going, but I haven't had the time to devote to it lately to do that. If you've got ideas (and the time) go right ahead and push on forward. I'll contribute when I can, 'cuz I still love Kalium. I've really enjoyed building it so far.
For links, most of them can be found in the General Kalium thread. The only one that I'm thinking of that isn't, is in the Force sub-forum. Other than that, I don't think much has really been decided.

I intend to start a Kalium game soon to give the project new direction and energy. I'm just making sure my new and old game get on track and stay there so that I can manage a third, rather than rushing into the scheme without foresight.

I've liked the idea of a unified play environment that addresses balance etc, so I've liked the basic idea of Kalium since I was 1st introduced to it. The specifics that set it apart seem to knocked around alot so I'd like to see it just set so we could move on.
Thanks for the replies and I'd like to see some specific questions brought up too perhaps?
