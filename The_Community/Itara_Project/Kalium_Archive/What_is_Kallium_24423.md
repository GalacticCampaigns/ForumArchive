# What is Kallium?

### **Avarna** (2009-10-08 18:53:27)

Instead of continuing a pointless argument, I feel the need to start something that I feel is more important. Its all good and well to talk about how the Force fits into Kalium, what technology is used in Kalium, What factions are in power, and so on and so forth.
But one question I feel has never been answered to my satisfaction, or if it has it was so long ago that It was before my time. And that question is...
What is Kalium?
Whats the big puzzle that we're trying to put together?
Is it simply a region of space outside the unknown space in the main stream universe? Or is it something totally different.

Whut? no one has an answer to this?
I was under the impression that it was unrelated to the Star Wars Universe 'somewhere' else.
It just seems that Saga rules, some of the old races and good old humans are convenient >.> Alternate universe or reality could be applied

originaly Kalium was set out to be a sector in the known star wars galaxy. Many members began to give input and a vote was help sector or seperate galaxy. Galaxy won out, so consider this a star wars setting similar to how one could play DnD on greyhawk forgotten relams etc ....
Honestly the reason your question was never really answered is because it has not really been defined as of yet. Nothing worth doing is easy these things take time in a community setting members will continue to add their input which may or may not make final draft.

For some reason my initial spill for the Kalium Galaxy is not present. It detailed in a nicely written paragraph (or two) what the Kalium Galaxy was about.......thankfully I posted it elsewhere. Here it is:
> Everyone knows Star Wars, and the tales of its heroes. You&#39;re no doubt familiar with two stories in particular: The poor farm boy that is thrust into an impossible adventure and comes out a hero; or the young slave rescued from Tatooine by the Jedi.
> It&#39;s old, it&#39;s familiar. &quot;Classic&quot;, if you will. But what if there were a different galaxy far, far away? One without Luke or Vader, Han or Leia? A Galaxy full of new adventures and unexpected encounters? A place you&#39;re not familiar with at all?
> If your interest is piqued, read on.
> With the help of the community, we plan to create a new and unique Galaxy. Players will have access to the same options as ever - for example, the Force is ever-present and the Jedi Order will have a place, albeit a less focal one - but it will be a very different place with very different play experiences.
> Were being careful not to destroy that Star Wars feel and yet create something new. Most of the weapons, technology, and species you are familar with are still present. New member created Planets, Equipment, Weapons, and Species will give players and GM&#39;s alike endless possiblities for adventures.

As it says there, Kalium was in the same universe as your current Star Wars. Just far away in another galaxy not yet mapped out via Hyperspace travel (if it ever will be). There were several ways one could get to the Kalium, the most popular at the time was a hyper drive malfunction. This would explain why Twi’Leks, Zabracs and other technology from the Star Wars universe was present in this new galaxy. It would also be populated by its own tech having been around as long as the Star Wars Galaxy.
Kalium was also thought about in other terms before it became its own Galaxy. It had been purposed at first as a War Game type of setting. Where we pick a time line to start, and through member campaigns (in that time line) advance a community story/history that the out come of each campaign would determine. (ie. If the Sith were winning control over planets would sway, leading to resource control and capitalization. If the faction wanted it back a GM would create a game for that and if his characters were successful then the map would reflect that. (Its something I might work on in the future).
That type of gaming would lead to small campaigns that would finish quickly and the next could be looked for. A careful balance of good/bad side would have to be achieved to ensure fairness of course.
That’s it in a nut shell…..a brief Kalium Galaxy History. Hope this helps any confusion as to its direction.

I read the thread, and a story idea blossomed, to explain my view of the Kalium. Unlike other story ideas of mine, this one refuses to be completed in a single afternoon.
