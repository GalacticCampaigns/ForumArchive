# Welcome to the Itara Project

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-13 18:32:33)

Hello all, to our attempt to design a small section of space for use with the Star Wars setting!
As you no doubt already know, we are taking an old setting idea of mine, the Itara Cluster, and using it as the seed from which our ideas will sprout. This means several things:

* Some of the work is already done. This gives us a place to start, rather than leaving in a void. Those of you who helped with Kalium will no doubt agree that picking a focus is a good thing.
* The brief history I have for the Itara Cluster states that it was "discovered" in the waning days of the Old Republic. Does this mean the Cluster can't be used in earlier periods? No. And in fact it means we can have fun working out how it was discovered the first time, then lost, then found again. We have the opportunity to make the Cluster very different depending on which era it is used in!

  It is is usually best to pick one place to start on the timeline, then work out. Considering the existing material is intended chiefly for Legacy era, I intend that every new submission should be written for Legacy Era at first, and we will work backwards from this point in the timeline later on in the process.

I intend for the project to go forward in stages to make it more manageable. We are starting off with the Cluster's geography, so we have a strong sense of what the Cluster is and what features (planets, hazards, and so on) are present. From there, we will branch out to Cultures of the Cluster and keep taking steps in this manner until we have a strong sense of what the Cluster is like in Legacy Era. At this point we will begin work on History, working backward through the timeline, determining what is different about the Cluster in earlier eras and how it developed from era to era.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Submissions</span>
Everyone is welcome to make submissions at any stage. All that is asked is that they a) use the provided template for the feature they are submitting and b) respect the [rules and guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=17GvPUDG2I4LaBZrml0wgoF0meceX1f5_AWJJS5C7ndE "https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=17GvPUDG2I4LaBZrml0wgoF0meceX1f5_AWJJS5C7ndE").
When posting any content within the Itara Project forum, clearly identify whether you are posting a Concept (understood to mean content you're thinking about submitting but wish to brainstorm with the community first, or a Submission (understood to mean content you believe is ready to withstand the scrutiny of the submission process). Any post that is not clearly marked as a Submission will be assumed to be a Concept.
Before making any official submission, please make sure you are familiar with [the entirety of the submission process](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=17GvPUDG2I4LaBZrml0wgoF0meceX1f5_AWJJS5C7ndE "https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=17GvPUDG2I4LaBZrml0wgoF0meceX1f5_AWJJS5C7ndE").

Any questions you may have: now is the time and place to ask them!

I recall some concerns about consistency with ship and gear stats when this was Kallium. Official (published elsewhere) content sometimes didn't follow the construction/creation rules (this seemed to come up more often for ships). I didn't see it mentioned in the submissions guidelines but if this is going to be attached to the Cannon:GFFA (Galaxy Far Far Away) is there going to be something set-up for consistency?
If this is to be addressed elsewhere please move this question there & thanks.

Because the Itara Cluster is meant to be slotted into the GFFA, we have access to all the existing equipment, droids, and vehicles (not to mention species, force traditions, etcetera). Designing new items for Itara, and any guidelines that will need to be in place for that, is therefore very low on our priority list right now.
Here is a rough guide to how I see us approaching this:
Stage 1 - The Cluster itself: planets and features/hazards of the spacelanes.
Stage 2- The People: societies and governments, key factions. New species, and new force traditions (if any).
Stage 3 - Unique features: items produced within the Cluster that merit their own statblocks.
Stage 4 - History: Developing backward into other eras, defining what of the information we have developed applies in prior eras, what doesn't, and any new info and features that should be added during these time periods.
