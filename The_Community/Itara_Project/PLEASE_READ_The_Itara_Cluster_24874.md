# PLEASE READ: The Itara Cluster

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-05 17:37:35)

*Due to lack of interest I will **not** be lending my effort to revitalise the Kalium Galaxy. If others want to pick up that particular project they're welcome to discuss it with Alicia.* 
Instead, after lengthy discussion with other moderators and game masters, we have settled on a **more manageable replacement**. Rather than create an entire new Galaxy we will work on a single new sector intended to be slotted into the Lucas-verse. This will not only make the project much easier, but it will hopefully improve its appeal to those of you who weren't interested in Kalium!
We're using the Itara Cluster as the basis for our setting (you will recognise it if you read my short-lived campaign *Ripples in the Deep*), since the basic setup (particularly with regard to Legacy Era) is already developed and we will be able to focus on fleshing it out right from the get-go. We're going to put a submissions system in place that will make sure ideas get proper attention, decisions are made in timely fashion, and development does *actually develop.*
I will be Project Leader on this, and several game masters are already on board. I'm hoping that some of the rest of our community are willing to join in. This is not just a setting our community's Star Wars GMs can use. It's also a setting that you may very well visit during their games, so helping decide what the Itara Cluster is like really is something to be excited about! You can make sure you get to play in a world tailor-made for you and your fellow players, and for once have an unprecedented level of impact on the setting your GM has put you in! And how much more interesting would games on this site be (than they already are, of course!), if they were actually inter-connected in some way? A shared setting might pave the way to shared plots between games, and even characters moving between them.
Please, if you want to help with this amazing opportunity to get involved with the community and created a shared setting, and if you're willing to help us make this smaller project succeed where the larger one failed, then **post your interest below!**

This makes so much more sense than what was being done before. I am looking forward to opportunities to contribute to this! <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ --> <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

You know I'm definitely interested!
It seems too, that some of the content released for Kalium could be reworked for the Itara Cluster, making some slight edits here and there to make it better suited for the setting.

Absolutely, I have it in mind to put at least some of the Kalium content through the review process. Obviously some of it will be unworkable, and we will only consider those ideas that a) can be made to fit and b) at least one member champions the cause of.

By this time I think it goes without saying that IÂ´m interested in being part of any custom project we pursue on these boards. And I think starting small might be a good idea, and if this works out well, then perhaps we will be able to resume the Kalium project one day.

All right guys, given the response both here and among the GMs and Admin staff I think we have enough interest to get this off the ground. I'm going to ask Alicia to give us the Kalium development section for the Itara Cluster, and get the existing Kalium topic all moved into an archive forum (that way we can reference them if we need to for Itara, and all the stuff is still there if we later go back to the Kalium project).
Look for this change and further news regarding this project shortly.
