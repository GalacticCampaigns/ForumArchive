## Images - Campaign Application

### **Alicia** (2010-11-02 19:54:48)

If you want an image in the forum rules or a small forum logo, please provide the image.
**Forum logos** appear next to the Forum/Campaign name on the Index pages (IE. RPG, Free From and Star Wars images. The Genearl RPG games are another fantastic example.) The logo needs to be *50x50px** with a transparent background (let me know if you need help making the background transparent), this image will be hosted on the forum.

* This is the size of all the logos on the site in an effort to keep the look uniform. The width being the key factor, variances in height will be allowed as long as it is no larger than 50px
**Forum Rules images (or text)** will appear at the top of each thread in that forum (but not subforums unless specifically added). Rules images can be any size, but will still need to have the transparent background. These images can be hosted on the forum, but a link from an outside source may be used. Please keep in mind if you use photobucket, if the file is ever moved the image will no longer be displayed on the site. Best to put it where you want and then leave it.
Please keep in mind this site uses a varied selection of themes using colors from black, tan and white. Your images should be appropriate for the varied background color selections.
