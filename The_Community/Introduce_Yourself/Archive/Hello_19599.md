lol. I think that might be overkill. It's not the cat. It's the catnip you got to be worried about.

Hello to new person who just found out why there are fire houses everywhere around here. Zerah can be alittle enthuseastic some times. I hope you find a game to be envoled in (I hear Master Tru has one that is taking apps now.) There is always some one running a game around here. Hope to se you in one. There is also the Kaluim Galaxy stuff that is a home made galaxy far far away. This is something that is close to the boss but he lets us play around in there as much as we want. So look around and have fun.
