~glares at phoenix~ I don't know why you insist on helping bob stop me from greeting new people, I did the same friendly greeting to you when you came on and to bob when HE came on. I am simply being friendly.
~looks to new person~ hello! I'm being stopped from my usual greeting -.- but all the same welcome ^^

I never made a introductory topic for myself.
And it is only to stop you from jumping on the new peoples and injuring them. :P

### **zerah** (2008-07-23 14:28:10)

I have yet to injure anyone! and your welcome was given while we were in game =P

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-23 14:30:20)

Welcome to Galactic Campaigns...
where the campaigns are.... galactic... O_o;
Anywho... don't worry about zerah, she didn't even pounce on me when I first got here...
::thinks for a moment:: Wait.... zerah didn't pounce on me....
I don't think zerah likes me very much <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

We really should set a limit for 1 post per person...really, when a forum with barely 100 (not all active) memebers has 108 posts in a greetings thread, you starts to wonder... <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->
Anyways, welcome to the site <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

That would make greeting threads much more boring, I quite enjoy the battles against zerah and thelastfool. :P
