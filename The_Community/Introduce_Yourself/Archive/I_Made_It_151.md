I was going to wait until I could be member 37, but I'm not known for my patience. Good to be here and the site looks awesome.

Thanks for the welcome...Everyone else seems to be telling a lot more about themselves. Here's me bending to peer pressure:
I lived in Saint Louis for the past five years, but moved back to my home town of Chicago after a tree relocated into my last apartment. I'm a struggling writer/college student. I too know the deep pain of buying expensive RPG books only for them to collect dust as I searched in vain for players.

Its really sad how many I have purchased over the years and never got to use them. But what can we say right, RPG nuts all the way. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">While I do the same, it more because I am trying to add more weight to the Western side of the country. I figure, with enough RPG books, I can pout my state into the ocean. </span>

I bought every Rifts book that came out and only played it a handful of times. My Palladium play pals always seemed to evaporate. Oh well, now we have this. Of course it will be littered with the below smiley.

Yay, Sage is here how's it going man. I have to say that I understand where you are coming from I have Rpg books siting on the self and they are collecting dust. I think only about five or six of the books have seen good use. But I will buy more so oh well.
