Whoah, new forum, same people (Looks nice, btw, Rowen).
For those who don't know, I'm tobias. I run Broken Images, which should get started back in full swing soon.
To my players, I was at a convention all weekend (Anime Weekend Atlanta, if you must know), and I'm technically homeless now, though I do have internet.

Hey good to see you made it. I am sorry to here about the homeless part. I hope you can find aplace to stay. If anything else you can crash at a friends house or something. Look forward to the game to start back up again.

Welcome to the new site. I know all about the lack of housing thing. Hope your situation gets worked out.

You have an internet connection, so your never homeless with us around.
Hello and Welcome, I'm new and wish I had found these forums a long time ago. Looks like I found how I am going to spend my late nights ...
