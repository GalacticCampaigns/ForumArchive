# I guess reintroductions are in order

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-13 21:19:50)

Hey Gang!
I am back to GC after getting my arse handed to me by life. I won't bore you with the details here.
I apologize to anyone who had a game interupted by me going MIA.
To those who I knew before I left: What's going on??
To those who have joined the family while I was gone: **RUN AWAY**... err... I mean... welcome
<span style="font-size: 0.01em;">(seriously, run away)</span>

welcome not so new person
hmm, a lot of members have joined, a few have disappeared, and I've been making posts in the Kalium Galaxy like a machine.

I hope progress is being made overall here at GC... as far as recruitment and gaming goes.
How is the Kalium Galaxy project going?

well, we've had a slight influx of players, thanks to pink jedi ranger (or zoe), as her game that she decided to start here brought quite a few new people. Though since Yogi suggested to her we play here, we should thank him too.
The kalium galaxies got quite a few more species, double in fact (many made by me, lol). Also, we have a few more planets, and MoDaVader has made a really good map (which he continously updates). We have a few new factions (many using the organization rules from Force Unleashed Campaign Guide) and two force traditions stated by myself. We are also currently working on the "Great War" which is supposed to be the biggest war of the galaxy, and the first canon event we make.

I'm not sure if it'll help but feel free to use the Karia Sector I drew up for my (now on hold) game *Tales of the Starfore Prince* for the Kalium Galaxy.
If anything, it'll provide some more planets and descriptions even if all the "Empire" and "New Republic" fluff is stripped away.

cooleo, good to have one more person making (even if it's reposting, it was still created) stuff

I'm glad to be back!

Nice to see you again, we were wondering where you went off to.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 12:07:39)

What is important is that I am back and I am ready to roll some dice!
Is Flames of War still going on, DA? I wouldn't mind playing with Jace some more <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->D

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 12:31:54)

I hope Flames of Wars is still going, I'd like to play it more. Alas, we might be the only two players.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 13:36:14)

Does Myrkr need more than two Jedi to defend it?
Not if those Jedi are you and I, MoDaVader!
I think I am still flying somewhere above Myrkr with a flight of snubfighters defending escaping transports.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-14 14:36:18)

Yup, since your sidestory was easy enough to put aside, you didnÂ´t suffer the same fate as the other players that vanished.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 14:53:11)

Sweet! I guess I should read what happened to the other Jedi when I get some time. I hope they are all ok.
If not, Jace may have to make good on that Destruction Destiny he has and enact some Lightsaber Justice! :
Well, DA, if the game is still on, could I re-join?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-14 15:08:25)

Of course. You are pretty much still wher you left, so pick up however you want.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-29 22:48:33)

HEY EVERYBODY! Well You may or may not have guess it by now but I am someone you once new!
*Drums Roll* Xeladin = Xandiel!!! OH SNAP!
Yeah anyways to explain where I have been, well I became unemployed so I didn't have cash and no cash means no internet...*tears* and I was also having Health Issues, like blood coming from behind the eye, but I is all fixed though I for the life of me could not remember any of my old account stuff, somewhat of memory loss but I remembered the site and I am doing good again so I made a new account! Though considering I have been gone awhile I suppose I have been removed from the games (Great ones from Sacred and Frost!)
SO ummm what did I miss and did anyone miss me?
