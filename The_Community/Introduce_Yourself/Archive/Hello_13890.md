### **Anonymous** (2008-07-25 22:52:05)

Hello all~
New to post by play games but not new to Star Wars RPG and D&D. Have been playing for over fifteen years now and have great respect for the game and the stories people put together. Used to play a lot of D&D and found it to be the same lame old dungeon crawl every time we made up characters and got everything on the way. Turned to Star Wars due to its expansive settings and unlimited possibillities.
A little about me is that I am a father to a four month old little girl who already ahs me wrapped around her finger and have been married for five years now. Live in Michigan and would love to move where I could find a job that pays me a decent wage...if a decent wage still even exist these days.
As I stated prior I have never done a post by play game and would love to jump into one and see what its like. My favorite era is the clone wars, I say this because I feel its when the jedi were tested the most of their skill and temptation to the dark side. I also feel that after oreder sixty-six the jedi mastery of lightsaber combat was lost. For every Luke Skywalker fan out there I am one fan who does not like him. I feel his teachings and self proclaimed grand master is a joke but someone needs to sell books. Due to my ignorance of Luke I have not read to many novels past the clone wars although I am trying to now.
If anyone would like an experienced player but lacks knowledge in post by play let me know I am very interested in playing.

First off, welcome to the forums! Its good to have you with us.
If its a game your interested in keep an eye out on the "Casting Calls" that is what our GM's use to announce games and spot fill announcement when they need an extra player.
Play-by-post is much easier in a sense than a live game. Its much-much slower as well. It will take little adjustment to fit in with a pbp game. If you need help or are confused about anything pbp related to hesitate to ask.
We have the best community on the net and our members are very helpful. Of course we have a pesky kitty that gets into endless trouble (eyes Zerah), but that's their nature.
Again, welcome to the forums.

Thanks Rowen. I was browsing through that forum prior to even joining and its what caught my eye. Didn't see many games that were open for new players but i'll keep my eye out for them. I'm hoping to get into a game and get the jist of what its like to post and play and eventually run my own game. But as I am just getting my feet wet with this new play style one foot at a time <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Welcome new person.
*Erects the obligatory anti-zerah protection device.* Watch out for zerah. She bites.

~glares at bob while doning the anti-anti-zerah suit that would let her pass through~ I don't bite unless asked and I've had my shots and I only bite my bf -.- now then. ~hugs the new person~ hello!

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-26 00:50:24)

Its nice to see there is a sense of humor in the forums. I mean how many people don a special suit just to get past a force field to bite someone then turn around and greet little ole me. 8)
On a side note how does character creation work here? I mean most of my games I am a jedi master due to great adventures and hardships. I don't wish to jump into the forums as a new player and demand the title but would like to ask hows it all work?

hello gm visto, glad to see you moved over hear from the wizard's forums.
Oh, good, bob set up the anti-zerah shield.
Character creation depends on the GM, what kind of campaign, and what lvl the GM starts you at.

Hey.
Jedi are freakin' stupid power hungry sociopathic murders anyhow. I don't think they count as living anymore (perhaps a droid like template?). I think the better stories are told from the point of view of the clone troopers, or the volunteer warriors, or the street theives trying to survive in the city that turned into a battlefeild.
But this is just me. I despise Force Users, especially Jedi.
Oh, and welcome to the forum.

Well although I don't share your view of jedi I do have to say I love the Clone Trooper novels by Karien Travvis. It's a great set of storys and if I ever had to play a trooper it would be a Null ARC Trooper enough said :

Although browsing through a lot of people are anit jedi lol

Mostly just me. As far as I can tell, everyone else either likes them or doesn't care either way.

Hello and welcome to the site <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I agree with you on the clone wars its a very good setting, I would love to see a game set in that era on the site.

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-26 11:09:30)

Welcome to Galactic Campaigns, GM Visto!
The Clone Wars is a good setting. Plenty of opportunities for Jedi and non-Jedi characters alike to do some heroics.
I think a game where you are playing Seperatists would be pretty interesting.

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-26 15:47:20)

A Sep point of view on the clone wars would be interesting but the only problem I would have is I would be gunning for Jar Jar and Nute Gunray regardless of cannon and take the DSP's just for the joy of doing it. --][--

Welcome
If you feel like doing it, you could always start up a game of your own

> Welcome

I orginally wanted to get into a game so I could get the lay out of the play sytles. Since I have been looking around most games have been started and as you posted this I was in the process of saying the heck with it I will run one and share my experience with others. :

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-26 19:05:37)

And I decided to join your game, as my others are going a little slow.

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-26 20:43:57)

Thanks for joining Sacred and hope we can get the game moving within the week :P
