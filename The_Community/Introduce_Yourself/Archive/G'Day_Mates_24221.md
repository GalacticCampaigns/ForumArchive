I guess should probably introduce myself since I've been playing in Alicia's game which has a play-by-post section on this site, and I've hung out on the chat occasionally (so some of you already know me). Been awhile since I've done one of these so lets see how it goes.
I'm Darren, I've been roleplaying around 3 years now, and running games for about 6 months less then that. I tend to run mostly modern horror and Sci Fi games in general (although I'm planning to try my hand at a Fantasy game in a few weeks).
I look forward to chatting and perhaps playing with you.
Darren
