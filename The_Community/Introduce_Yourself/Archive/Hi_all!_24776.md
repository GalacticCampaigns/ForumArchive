# Hi all!

I'm Jake, and I'm looking to play a Saga game. I'm hoping to play a force user of some kind or a soldier. I just picked up a bunch of the books at a garage sale. I haven't done SW RPG since the d20 system, but I think I understand these rules.

Welcome
If you are looking for a military game, IÂ´m running a legion of stormtroopers that always needs new recruits.
