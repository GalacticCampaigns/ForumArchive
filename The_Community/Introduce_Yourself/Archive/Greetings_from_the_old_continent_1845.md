# Greetings from the old continent

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-04 09:30:16)

Hi all! Seems like I'm probably the only European here, so I hope the time difference wouldn't be a problem. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Anyway, a little about me ... I'm about to turn 30, married (w/o kids sofar) and quite a big fan of SW. I've got a history with both P&P and online RPGs. Started playing D&D about seven years ago and went through many alternative systems such as ST (storytelling system by White Wolf), GURPS, TriStat, Star Wars d20, d20 Modern and others, lately I started with SW SAGA.
As for my online experience, I took part in a few pbps, been playing SW Combine since 2005, LineageII since 2004 and WOW since the last year.
I like making up stories but don't have the patience to actually sit down and write something serious, such as a novel, so I guess I'll stick with RPGs for a bit longer <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
So, that's about it, but if you have anything else you may want to ask, then go ahead - I may want to answer .. or I may not <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

It's just me, DarthAnthrax, and now you.
But being in the minority is cool, at least we Europeans have a voice among the Moderators. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

**simplyscribed** has this really interesting Fantasy game he is putting together over at Worlds Beyond. Don't know if it's yer style, but here is the url:
<!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/worldsbeyond/index.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/worldsbeyond/index.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/worldsbeyond/index.php")<!-- m -->
And I remember watching a World War II movie- the Great Escape, I think where a bunch of British soldiers and a single American soldier were being held in a German POW camp. One of the British was talking with the American (not an exact quote):
British: "So, you're a yank, I hear."
American: "That's right."
British: "And how are you doing over there, without us?"

Hmmmh, the game sounds interesting.. I'll have a look at the details and see about it. I'd definitely like to apply, just not sure about the character 'style' yet.. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **simplyscribed** (2007-11-05 14:02:38)

You're certainly welcome to apply. I was going to cut off apps tomorrow, but I'll gladly extend things a few days to give you a chance to be involved.

Luckilly, I've managed to finish a draft of the character description earlier today. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> Already posted it into the topic on WorldsBeyond.. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
