I hate writing these things. Anyway, hello everyone I am obviously new here and new to Saga Edition Star Wars. I have been roleplaying off and on for 17 or 18 years now. With the last 5 or 6 years spent playing over various message boards. While I am a big Star Wars fan, it is not the only game I am interested in.
Anyway, I hope to see you on the boards.

Thank you all for the welcome. I am still in the process of reading the rules. I'd heard about Saga Edition before, but didn't have the money to pick it up until recently.
