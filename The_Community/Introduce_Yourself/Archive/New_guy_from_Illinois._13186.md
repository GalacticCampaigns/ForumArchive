# New guy from Illinois.

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-29 17:01:09)

Well, I have been moving around on the board now for a couple of days. I have requested to join a couple of games and even am looking to run one of my own. So it is about time I did this.
Want to give everyone a big hello as a new member to the boards. I live in Illinois and work for a private forestry company. This of course puts me at the weirdest hours for work and I am actually on call...like a lot of jobs it seems now. Though I try to get on and do posting at a set time, I sometimes just have to go with my schedule and do it whenever.
Just a little about me, myself. I am 33 years old and unmarried. I have a girlfriend that is as big a gaming geek as I am though. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I mostly play D&D and started back mostly with 2nd Edition, then moved onto 3rd and 3.5 as they came out. A friend of mine got me to try out the original D&D but his game did not last long and I have never had the chance to try it again. Mostly I play D&D 3.5, looking into 4 Edition, and a little Star Wars. I just got into Star Wars a couple of years ago and just had to get the Saga books when they came out.
Unfortunately my gaming group that I use to play with has all moved away or they do not have that much time to play anymore. I on occassion am able to play Magic, Spellfire or a number of other different card games at a local gaming shop...but that is not as often as I would like. Mostly I spend my freetime either playing video game, rpgs mostly, or reading sci-fi and fantasy books...for me reading is sort of a passion.

~rises from the shadows~ "Welcome new person. sorry about Zerah." ~turns to Zerah~ "Bad Zerah, if you keep this up... I'm giving Bob your leash and never returning to the forum." ~turns back to the new guy~ " Well... welcome again. You won't see much of me on the here due to real life." ~bows and returns to the shadows~

Welcome new guy from Illinois!
I think we may have to set up a New Guy Trap Thread on Zerah and catch that wild pouncing animal <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)
