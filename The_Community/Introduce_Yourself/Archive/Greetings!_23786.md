I'm looking for a fairly active Saga Edition play-by-post forum, and this seemed to match that description.  I'll say up front, I've never actually played a Saga Edition game, but I own the Core Rulebook, TotG, SotG, and the KotOR campaign guide.  I've read a lot on the Saga Edition forums, but never really participated in any kinds of discussions.  My problem is: I have NO ONE to play with.  ^^'

Well, Welcome to our little game. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Your not the only one with no one to play with locally, I guess that's why there is such a game. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Welcome to the forum! I'm glad you found us.
When looking for a game pay particular attention to the 'Casting Calls' in the era part of the forums. That's where GM's post letting players know they are accepting players. Its a pretty good system really. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
I hope you find a good game to participate in. If you have any questions feel free to post asking them....we have a great group of people here that are more than willing to help.
