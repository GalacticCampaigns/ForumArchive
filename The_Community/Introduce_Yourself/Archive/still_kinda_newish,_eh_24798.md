*wanders off trying to figure out how to get rid of elmer's glue and catnip, the has a suitable Wyle E. Coyote moment involving the requisite unknowing walking off a cliff, landing in box of dynamite with lit fuse, exploding, falling back to bottom of cliff, then having an Acme brand anvil land on his head*

fine fine.
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be traveling on now
There's too many places I've got to see
If I stay here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, and the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Bye-bye babe, it's been sweet, love
'Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But if I stay here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, and the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord help me I can't change
Oh No, I can't change
but i prefer Sweet Home
