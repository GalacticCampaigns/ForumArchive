Hi everyone, Ossai here
I am a fan of the Star Wars universe and have played many of the computer games, I may also venture into the RP area of it...however, I am more of a warhammer person (both 40k and fantasy)
I was linked here by Inquisitor Tybalt, and I also know Tempeste (though not very well...) as such I hope to join his DH campaign.
Also, this in my new favourite smiley: <!-- s:jawa: -->:<!-- s:jawa: -->
Jawas Rule!
