# 'Lo!

'Lo!
I am Doctor Otaku. I have been a friend of Sketchpad's for a number of years. He got me interested in this site when he told me his plans for setting up some PbP games.
I've been a gamer since 1981. I've played both d6 and d20 Star Wars. Actually have a campaign that jumped form d6 to d20 about halfway through. Surprisingly, I've never played a Jedi and any other type of Force user. I have tended to play in the timeline between the Battle of Endor and the beginning of the Thrawn Trilogy. But I am open to playing in other settings.

Welcome aboard. If you want to know whether a game setting would interest you, just take a look at the games we've currently got in place. Poke around, have fun. Visit the chat room. **Korihor coughs as he realizes that he hasn't in a while, though he hasn't been able to get on the past few days. Malfunctions of some sort.**
*Korihor throws a cat toy on the ground at Otaku's feet.*
Enjoy! Got a water pistol?

### **Yogi** (2009-06-22 13:02:30)
