# Greetings - Again!

Hey guys,
I was a member back at Galactic Adventures, and ran a fairly successful OpenRPG based Saga game for a couple months before I up and disappeared due to real life.
When things settled down and I came back, I thought the community died :P.
Glad to see that its still around on another site (thanks Alicia! Glad I stumbled onto you on ORPG).
Looking forward to possibly getting some Star Wars RPing (or maybe GMing) in again in the near future!
