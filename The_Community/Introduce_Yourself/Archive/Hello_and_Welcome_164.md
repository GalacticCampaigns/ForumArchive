# Hello and Welcome

### **Rowen** (2007-09-26 08:05:10)

I've been slacking and its time I added my little bit of info.
I live in good old Georgia and am a practicing nurse with the local hospital. I work the surgical floor and sometimes I have some weird schedules. So If you ever see me only posting late at night, you know why. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
I'm married and have 4 children. I'm 32 years old. I've only played D&D before Saga came out even though I owned several of the RCR Books. I also own several other Table Top RPGs as well. My gaming experience is very little, while I owned the books I've never had a gaming group to play with.
SO I had the bright idea (and there are only a few a year) to make a forum to play games on. I've never looked back since. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

And where all glad you did. So are you going to contenui the lurker status? =]--

### **Rowen** (2007-09-26 13:45:01)

As it stands now there is no need for a lurker status. Anyone at any time can read what is happening in the games. This allows more people to keep up with a game there interested in just in case there is an opening.

Still can't get access to the games. Keeps coming up nd saying you need special permission.
