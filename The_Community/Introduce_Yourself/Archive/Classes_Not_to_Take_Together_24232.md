# Classes Not to Take Together

### **chibiamy** (2009-06-22 17:47:28)

From practical experience, do not attempt to take English Composition (2010) along side History 4550. The sheer amount of writing needing to be done is overwhelming.
In fact, even though the semester ended in May I am STILL recovering from that experience.
Why the last month of school I had 3 essays, (2 with 3 re-writes each, 1 with another re-write for english), a term paper, a presentation and a book report due.
I have worn the paint off of some of my keys on my laptop.
Just in case you were wondering.
Anyway, I'm back, I hope, despite the mess that is July. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
And my classes, from here on out shall pertain of Art with the occasional Math and Foreign Language.
I think I can do this! SQUEEEE!
Therefore I present to you:
Chibiamy, Part-Time Student, Full-Time Mother, Wacky Member of the Forums, and ... well ... creator of unique characters. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Hello there. And welcome back, I guess. And hopefully you did well on all that homework.

Yaay! Another student to mess with! **Zen! where are you?**
Hi there. Korihor here, teacher extraordinaire. Though I torture *ahem* *teach* high school kids, I do enjoy hearing about the torturing methods of other professionals.
Welcome back, I guess. Enjoy the insanity.

I'm in my plotting room, plotting your doom. ...Er, wait... um... *You didn't hear that! These aren't the words you're looking for.* Crap, it's not working! :P

What's this? What's this? Sor got up from the pilot's chair only to fall backwards on Koyi's training saber? That happened to be lit? And the saber went somewhere not so nice? What's this? >:D

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-06-23 04:05:46)

...here I was thinking you were going to say something like Rogue and Barbarian or something. Maybe Jedi Healer and Dark Side Marauder.

### **chibiamy** (2009-06-23 09:55:44)

So...
What have folks been up to?
What's goin' on around here?
Anything interesting?

---

### **Yogi** (2009-06-23 09:59:11)

Welcome back Chibiamy. We were talking about you the other day in the chat saying that we hadn't seen you in a while.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-23 10:04:24)

Ha! Good stuff, chibi's back! Welcome, welcome!
It seems like lately is the time for prodigal sons and daughters to return. I did so myself only a few weeks back. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **chibiamy** (2009-06-23 10:11:00)

Its such a shame you just missed the reopening of Anazider's casting call. And my casting call too.
This is the sadness.

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-06-23 10:37:11)

It's the perfect time to open your own casting call though!
Just saying.. Not like I'm desperate to get into a game or anything ><
(There's only so long you can spend toying with Jawa builds...)

*shakes a fist at Simply*
You're just too fast! I could have pulled out my old Errant Knight I made!
Who doesn't love a Zeltron Force User? Seriously?
Who walks around w/o shoes whenever possible!

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-23 14:05:37)

Well....
I may have another project on the sidelines.
*puts the cat back in the bag and walks off whistling*

Planning something, are you?
(And I just noticed, I did these quotes in the wrong darn order! D'OH! Oh well, it's a blonde day! Everyone celebrate!)

### **Anazider** (2009-06-23 14:25:56)

Hey Amy, stop by the chat if you get a chance.

---

### **chibiamy** (2009-06-23 15:12:36)

It's not liking this computer, let me boot my other one.

No, no. Not at all. What gave you that impression?

### **chibiamy** (2009-06-23 15:44:30)

I am a MIND READER!
See my Giant Afro that hides my large brain? O0
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-23 15:46:28)

And this is why I don't approve of smilies. People can't be trusted with them!

---

### **chibiamy** (2009-06-23 15:52:13)

Be glad we don't have some of my favorites from deviantart!
>:D

Why won't that one work? It's so perfect. *pout*

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-23 16:15:17)
