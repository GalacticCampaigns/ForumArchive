# Hello everyone!

Hello everyone here at Galatic Campaigns! My name is ChainRiffer, or Chain for short. I've just started getting into the Saga Edition of Star Wars RPG. I've never played this version, and I'm itching to get into some PbP games here!
Do I need to give any more info for everyone?
*Looks around, curiously...*

Welcome Chain! Glad you could join us.
Keep an eye on the casting calls. I know Ripples in the Legacy Era is re-casting at the moment and there's always a game looking at some point or another. When you feel ready, we will be happy to support any games you wish to run here.

Welcome **indeed**. Like Alicia said, just keep an eye on the casting calls and you'll find a game you'll like.

Welcome
As have already been said, keep an eye out on the casting calls, those that are not labeled "closed" are usually looking for more people.

Hi ChainRiffer, and welcome to the site. Are you by chance a guitarist?
I won't repeat the already repeated advice, but I will confirm that I'm currently re-casting my game, *Ripples in the Deep*, which is a Legacy Era game. Prior knowledge of this Era isn't a necessity, since you could always look what you need know up on Wookieepedia! If you do want to apply, I will be posting a guide and a deadline tomorrow.
I should perhaps warn you that joining my game might be the equivalent of plunging in at the deep end, though. But what better way to learn, right?

Well I guess everyone else has said all there needs saying. There is always a game going on here. I think a few of us our thinking about starting one up or something. Welcome to the site I hope you find a good group to play with or maybe you'll run something who knows. Later.
