# Greetings!

Hello everyone! I've had this account since last October, but I've mainly been a lurker. Now, I'm ready to come out of the shadows and into the light! Kind of like a redeemed Jedi. :
Anyways, I'm from Missoula, Montana and I am a college student and the University of Montana. Sometime in the future, I'll be an English/Spanish teacher. I've been playing/interested in the SWRPG since the good old D6 days, which I started playing in 1999. Once the new d20 version arrived, I quickly switched sides and have been following the game since the Original Core Rulebook to the Saga Edition. I haven't had many chances to play here in Montana, but I've played in a few online games.
I'm hoping to meet some people with the same interests and love of Star Wars as I have and to hopefully play in some pbp campaigns.
Thanks for providing a great community!
