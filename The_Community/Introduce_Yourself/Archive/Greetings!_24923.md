Hi everybody,
I've been gaming for a little over 5 years now. I started out on D&D 3e and moved on to SWSE and D&D 4e. I have dabbled in numerous other systems including Pathfinder, Traveler, DC Adventures and many others. All of my rp experience has been with pen and paper; this is my first time on a play-by-post site.
Good gaming!

Welcome
As Sketch said, don´t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Everyone in this community is helpful and will surely do their best to help you. The Casting Calls are located in the forums off the particular Roleplaying genre you make be looking at playing and they´re your best shot for getting started. Look for one that says (Open) in its title, check it out, and if you´re interested, send in a character. Questions are best directed at the person who started the casting call, or anyone currently in that game.
Please feel free to pop into the chat room as well available via the header when you are logged in. There's generally someone in there and if not where there's one person others will gather.
