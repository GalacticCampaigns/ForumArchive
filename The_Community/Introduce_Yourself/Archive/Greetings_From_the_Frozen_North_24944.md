# Greetings From the Frozen North

### **Anonymous** (2010-12-11 19:47:26)

Hey there, everyone.
Name's Cyril, and I was referred here by ganthet a few days back. Always looking for more chances to RP, so I figured I'd stop by and check things out.
I recognize a lot of familiar user names, and yes, I'm the same Cyril from the d20 Radio boards as well as numerous places around the net.
Anything else you want to know, go ahead and ask.

Welcome Cyril! Glad you have come to join us! I remember seeing your name when I would pop onto the d20 boards.
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). When you find a game, you're next step is to contact the GM and take a look to see if the game is already in progress. Most of the games are currently active, so it would be a good idea to look through them to see if it turned out to be the sort of game which interests you.
Should you have any questions, our community is exceedingly helpful and don't find it a bother to help their fellows out. Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not, someone will pop in if you linger just to meet you.

I once knew this guy named Cyril who lived in Kelowna.
That's you right?

Since when did any place in the US (except maybe Alaska) become "the Frozen North"? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Welcome to the boards! If you have any questions, just ask ... it's a great community ... excuse me, looks like the reception's getting bad. I'd better hop on my Tauntaun and head over to Echo Station ...

Good.
You still owe me a hamburger then.
