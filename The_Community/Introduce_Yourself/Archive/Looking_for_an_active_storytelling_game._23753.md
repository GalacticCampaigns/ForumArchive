# Looking for an active storytelling game.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-22 22:54:56)

Hey guys.
Im a long time roleplayer, who is in his late 30's and leads a secret life as a high level bank manager. None of my peers understand my hobbies so I keep my nerdiness secret and under wraps. Lately I have been trying to branch out and explore a bit more of my creative side. I have both GMed and played in many Play by Post games on the Reaper Miniatures boards. I have also played some saga-edition games on <!-- m -->[http://www.saga-edition.com](http://www.saga-edition.com "http://www.saga-edition.com")<!-- m -->. I like that site. They are nice fellows, but its the same 5 guys playing in 7-8 differen games simultaneously.
id like to find a group that posts mulitple times a day, but only concentrates on a single game. id also like to find a game that allows a small ammount of coloborative storytelling (so I as the player could write describing my surroundings in detail, as long as I dont say anything that impacts the plot, should have been decided by a skill roll, or causes another PC to take an action.)
Here is some examples of my writing, the background for two characters I was attempting to play.

and

I shure would like to get in on an active, interesting, mature game with not too many players.
Thanks a bunch!

Welcome to the site. We have games starting up pretty frequently. We use a system here called 'Casting Calls' for recruiting and filling games. Each respective era has a casting call. Start browsing threw them and see if there are any you like. You can also preview any game currently going on and see if any have a style you like.
Hope you find the game your looking for. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

"Uhhh.. HI?" he says getting up off the ground and looking at the retreating form of Zera. "That was extreemly odd!"
Looking around, confused Diggitydug tries to decide what to do with the waterballons. Considering his options he decides to put them in his pants, to save them for later.
"That should do it!", he smiles confidently.
