...and I'm an alcoholic.
This isn't AA? :P
It's refreshing to find an entire forum dedicated entirely to PbP Star Wars. I'll be snooping around for a little, don't mind me.

Don't believe him. He lies, and nukes all my entries out of pure spite.

That's because I point Ro in your direction.
Welcome to the psych ward...I mean site.
*hands newcomer a water balloon*
You're going to need it.
*Yogi steps back and waits for it*

You just blew your load early mate....

You'll wish you hadn't done that when Zerah shows up. Welcome.

From one newcomer to another, welcome Chimaera ... so far it's been a fun place and no one's targeted me with any turbolasers yet ...

Aw, hell. I knew I forgot something. I'll find some turbolaser quality trouble for you, and make ya feel right at home.
And hey, swing by the Kalium Galaxy, read some, and add yer own insights. Every little bit of input from every person makes it better. And it's Rowan's pet project, so that might get you in better with the boss man.
...even if he is a sadist overlord who abuses us for his own amusement.

~Dashes in and tackles the new person with a grin~ Hiya! welcome to your new home! ~dashes off to tackle Yogi, then Tru, then Ro and sits there~

See you should have kept the water balloon. It was only a matter of time.

Thanks for the epic welcome, guys.

There comes a time in every man's life when he must give up that link on his bookmarks toolbar, them pesky morning forum-checking habits and all that unhealthy, *less-than-Christian*, roleplaying. Fortunately, my time is yet to come. While I can't imagine that many of you will miss my less-than-witty banter in the GC chat or my rather high-strung roleplaying in your various games, I can assure you that I have enjoyed the company of many of the great gamers here on the GC forums and am genuinely sorry that I have chosen to leave your fine community.
That's right. Elvis has left the building. *And he's taking Silas' leg with him!*
Goodbye and good gaming.

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-20 23:21:20)

Hang on! Chim, you leaving?

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-21 00:49:12)

Yes, I'm afraid I am. While I have found my time here enjoyable, I've found that I seem to have rubbed a great many people the wrong way(If you're thinking *Huh?* then I don't mean you :P), intentionally or through no fault of my own.
That said, I don't really think I can stay here without the situation steadily escalating, so I figured it'd be best if I just leave on my own terms.
You needn't worry, killing Haden off won't be that difficult at this point. Can't say as much for my *other* game, where they've already replaced me.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-06-21 01:57:50)

Huh?
...
...
...somebody had to say it.

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-21 09:06:25)

Well, Chim, though you probably won't read this, I wish you well. Hope you find a place where you can play your particular breed of characters without causing, ... What did you call it? *Rubbing people the wrong way?* I hope you have fun wherever you go.
So, ... Good gaming!

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-21 20:42:51)

Chimeara, although I only knew you for a short time I was not one of those that felt offended by anything you did. I hope that you find a place that you can enjoy roleplaying and wish you the best of luck finding a place you'll like playing. It was fun roleplaying with you.

### **Yogi** (2009-06-28 08:24:57)

Not sure how I missed this but have a good one.
