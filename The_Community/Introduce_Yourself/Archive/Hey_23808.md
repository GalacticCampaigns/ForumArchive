OK I've been here a while though I've started posting again recently. I never made an intro thread so I felt I may as well make one now. I'm pretty inexperienced with Swrp. Having Gm'd a few sessions before I'm now running a game here. And about to start playing in one as a Pc. Should be fun.
Cheers.

No, a bell, like the one I put on my cat when he was a kitten so that he wouldn't be able to pounce on my feet without being noticed beforehand.
