<!-- s:duel: -->:<!-- s:duel: -->
so not sure how the whole PbP works. kinda have an idea but not sure what ... OOC means and other lil' abreviations that I havent seen yet.
Any way, been into the whole mmo thing for a while, bought some rpg books for D&D3.5e and Star Wars SagaE. with some of the minis as well for the kids... they had fun but I think I sucked at GM'ing.
wanted to at least be able to PbP myself since no one in central CA plays... and since WotC decided not to pick up SWSe license.
names mac, am 30 yrs old and hope to get some gaming in...<div style="text-align: center;">

Welcome to Galactic Campaigns, Mac!
If you're new to online roleplaying, you've come to the right place. We've got several seasoned veterans here who'll be able to help you out, and it's a nice friendly community.
Here's a quick little glossary of acronyms you might see off the top of my head:
**OOC** is "Out of Character". When you preface a statement with this acronym, it means you as the player are about to say something, not the character. Many GMs (myself included) prefer any OOC to be left to the very end of the post and clearly marked in some way. I put it in double brackets so it really stands out: "((OOC: Alishai uses a move action to reach the stormtrooper, and a standard action to attack him with her lightsaber))". Most games also have a dedicated OOC thread you can post to.
**IC** stands for "In Character". It doesn't get used as much, because anything not OOC within a game is automatically assumed to be IC. You might see people use it while discussing games though: "OOCly, I'm starting to wish my character knew she's Force Sensitive. Pity there isn't an IC way for her to learn about it yet".
**OOG/IG** "Out of Game" and "In Game". Basically another way to say OOC/IC.
**WotC** "Wizards of the Coast."
**WEG** "West End Games". They published the first Star Wars RPG, so you might see them referenced now and again.
**OCR** Another leftover from latter days, this stands for "Original Core Rulebook" and refers to the first d20 version of the game.
**RCR** is the "Revised Core Rulebook".
**SWSE** or simply **SE** is "Star Wars Saga Edition"/"Saga Edition".
**DoD** stands for "Dawn of Defiance", a Saga Edition campaign that was published on the Wizards website.
These acronyms for Star Wars Saga Edition sourcebooks aren't really that commonly used here, but you might see them online generally:
**SotG** "Starships of the Galaxy". May also be referred to as **Starships**.
**TotG** "Threats of the Galaxy". May also be referred to as **Threats**.
**FUCG** "Force Unleashed Campaign Guide". May also be referred to as **Force Unleashed** or simply **Unleashed**.
**CWCG** "Clone Wars Campaign Guide" May also be referred to as **Clone Wars**.
**KOTOR** or **ORCG** "Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide"
**LECG** "Legacy Era Campaign Guide". May also be referred to as **Legacy**.
**RECG** "Rebellion Era Campaign Guide". May also be referred to as **Rebellion**
**GaW** "Galaxy at War".
**SaV** or **S&V** "Scum and Villainy
**SGTD** "Scavenger's Guide to Droids". May also be referred to as **Scavengers**, **Droids**, or **Scavenger's Guide**.
**JATM** "Jedi Academy Training Manual". May also be referred to as **Jedi Academy**.
**GoI** "Galaxy of Intrigue". May also be referred to as **Intrigue**.
**TUR** "The Unknown Regions".

Howdy and Welcome! There's several games accepting applicants right now, one's a game of Stormtroopers, one a Rebel Alliance cell, one a Gladiator's Arena, plus several non-Star Wars games in the percolation process, namely one with a new system set in a high Fantasy setting. Pick a few games and read 'em through, you'll get the gist of PBP in no time.
Oh, and here's your welcome basket.
*hands a basket that reeks of catnip*
Just hold on to that real tight now, okay?
*runs away*

So you're new and your name is Mac
Should we devour you and call it a snack?
Maybe we'll pass
See if you've got sass
And get you addicted to crack
Hi, I'm Pete, and that's just a thing I do.
Oh and you forgot IIRC, Simply.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-13 03:40:48)

Welcome
Just look around the "Casting Call" threads, I think there are at least a few games seeking players right now.

As soon as someone shows up who is perpetually surrounded by a barrier of plexiglass there will be broken necks and mournful tears abundant.

### **Magical2099** (2010-10-13 07:47:21)

nope, Double S tried a cat proof bubble once, he got pounced as usual. Nothing seems to be able to stop the odd phenomenon, save one thing that I discovered: reverse psychology. I've dressed up in catnip before and escaped unscathed. Just want the pouncing, and you won't get it. Very simple when ya think about it. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

And as promised to Zerah I have an extra big bag of catnip for her.
