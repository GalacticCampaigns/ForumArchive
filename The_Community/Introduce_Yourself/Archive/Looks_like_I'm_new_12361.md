# Looks like I'm new

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-08 03:21:55)

Hello I found this site in someone's signature on the wizards boards. I love the star wars rpg and have been playing since OCR days (I was too young for WEG and I feel like I missed out on so much.... <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> sad panda)
Anyway I would like to start playing with the cool kids over here; so how do I get started? I would like to find a game as soon as I can. In the real world I am normally the GM and it will feel great to play, even if I'm playing with people who live in my computer.
And I just wanna use this icon:

You better watch out Goo or Zerah will make you her new pet! *Tackles zerah and puts her leash back on*
The best way to get started is to check the casting calls in the respective eras you are interested in. If you want to run a game go ahead and set up a casting call.

Welcome. You can start by checking out the casting calls. Any new games that needs players and any old games that has lost players and needs replacement players will be posted inside the casting call thread. Anyone can apply, but the GM has final say in who he/she recruits. I suggest you take some time with a good background and colorful character to gain acceptance. Good Luck. Not sure if there are any new games being post but keep your eye out. If you are interested in GM'n a game you can contact rowen, simplyscribed, or master tru and they should be able to get your started in your own forum thread. Poke around the Casting Calls thread there maybe an opening in an existing game, or a new one might be opening.

> Everyday, we wake us and bathe the sunshine which is given by the same sun. We are all human beings. We may have the same name, but we are different individuals. We may do different jobs or eat different foods. There are not two coins that are exactly the same in the world. So it is in WoW. In game, we may have the same work while cannot have the same name.

It was a spammer Yogi and now a goner.

### **Yogi** (2008-11-01 09:07:28)

Yup. I Pm'ed Rowed right after I posted the "?" and let him know. Funny how he waited a week to post anything.

### **Rowen** (2008-11-01 09:58:38)

I think it was a hack of sorts. Because I review all of the new members to make sure they are not spammer. You can always tell by there email address and website links lol. But I never saw this one....might have been he used some sort of hack to trip the system to think he joined a week ago which would not flag him as a new members. Not sure on that one.
Least we got'em! :

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-02 03:44:44)
