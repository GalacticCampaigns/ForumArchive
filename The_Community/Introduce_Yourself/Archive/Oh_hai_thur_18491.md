# Oh hai thur

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-02 12:35:38)

Greetings to you good people, i am the doctor. Lol jk, just something i heard once, (yes i know it was most likely from Dr. Who...one of my favorite shows of all time. Maybe it was from the Tom Baker series...>.> who knows eh?) RIght enough rambling. My name is Daniel. I am a Louisvillian, which subsequently also makes me a Kentuckian, logically. (Louisville Kentucky for all you poor confused people) I heard about this sight from the lovely Zerah. She is lovely, and is MY lovely. That being said, i joined because i like to rp (lovely = gf btw). I dont claim to be the best at it, but, seeing as how im an English Major....and in High-scool i got a perfect %100 in my creative writing class, id say im pretty damn good ~nods~.
RIght now that all that is out of the way, Random information! Im an Eagle scout, ive been on 6 cruises, The last was a two week cruise to and around Italy. Ive been to Disney-World more than any other person i know (except for those that work there....they have that on me). I was adopted 2 days old form my Romanian birth parents. No, im not a hick or a hillbilly. I am a human being with a big imagination...and severe case of adhd. Rping IS just about the best thing i can do, other than swim and make Zerah blush ~blows a kiss to her and waves~ I can also throw Tomohawks...Im the current Tomohawk champion in my Scout Troop. (99 in a row) I am 20, going to be 21 on November 17. I was born in 1987.
