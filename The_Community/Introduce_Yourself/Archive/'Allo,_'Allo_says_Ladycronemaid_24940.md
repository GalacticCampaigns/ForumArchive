Greetings from one who enjoys British television and roleplaying games (with dice rolls, not the other kind). My first ever character was a catgirl Mina in a pen and paper game in high school---I think she died when a zombie hugged her and exploded. Born 198_ (cough), unwed but in love, have 1 cat (because they're neater for apartment living, though generally I like dogs too for being friendlier). Gaming-wise I've experimented with 3.5, Pathfinder (favorite), & 4E (currently gaming live in a basement far from most of you, so far so fab). Some things about me...Love Terry Pratchett's writing (especially MONSTROUS REGIMENT), dislike William Styron's (especially SOPHIE'S CHOICE). Love Rocky Road, dislike butterscotch. Love Toronto, Canada but live in Cuyahoga Falls, U.S.A. which is still delightful. I do creative writing when I'm not too busy (not often). I've discovered one thing you can do with a BA in English is staff a reference desk in a library (which I do). Excited to try out an online game cuz' there may be more opportunities to roleplay social interaction and mental processes instead of rushing to the next fight (not that a good challenging fight or three doesn't feel great). <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

It's nice that you love Toronto, because someone really has to.
Otherwise, you are absolutely after my own heart.
Oh, and the butterscotch thing. I do loves me some butterscotch.

Welcome! Glad you have come to join us!
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). When you find a game, you're next step is to contact the GM and take a look to see if the game is already in progress. Most of the games are currently active, so it would be a good idea to look through them to see if it turned out to be the sort of game which interests you.
Should you have any questions, our community is exceedingly helpful and don't find it a bother to help their fellows out. Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not, someone will pop in if you linger just to meet you.

"Hello Nighthawk, hello Nighthawk. Are you receiving, over?"
"'Allo, 'allo. This is nighthawk. We are receiving you, loud and crackly."
I assume this show is the reference? If not, never mind. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Seeing as you like English television, Terry Pratchett, writing, and roleplaying, I think we should get on charmingly considering I also like all these things and *am* English.
Welcome to the forum! We've had quite the influx of new blood lately.

Thanks, all, for the warm welcome. The site seems very user friendly indeed, and the people even more so. Looking forward to chats and such between adventures. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
In Toronto's defense, it has LOTS of used bookstores, miles of them, and it's the one place I've been able to see the greatest musical of all time: WE WILL ROCK YOU.
Pop is THE best librarian character (no offense to Marian). And in reference to "'Allo, 'Allo,"James Bond has nothing on Rene Artois!
