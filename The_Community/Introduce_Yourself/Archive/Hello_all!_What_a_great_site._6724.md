# Hello all! What a great site.

### **Anonymous** (2008-02-14 18:26:44)

Hi I have been lurking around reading stuff on here for a week or so, found it off of the WotC forums and have to say I love the idea of a solely Star Wars RPG site with PbP and all the other shiny goodness. Have been loving following Tru and simplyscribed's thread in the GM section on the Legacy era as I think that era is quickly becoming my favorite and am trying to currently get my tabletop group to start a campaign in it.
Anyway... My name is Sean Quigley and I am from Philadelphia. 29 yrs old and started rpg'ng about 2 years ago now. That's about it for now I guess, hope to see some cool things on here and hopefully contribute some as well and maybe even get in on a PbP ( although I have never participated in one before but they look cool )

I want to thank everyone for the welcome, even Breederofpuppets since it's always good to know who's going to be "that guy". jk.
Will definitely start reading up on your Legacy Campaign Master_Tru and have been following the thread you and simplyscribed have been doing in regards to his campaign. I plan on starting a Legacy campaign with my tabletop group as well and always looking for ideas.
Anyways, look forward to enjoying the content here alot.

~is tackled and force lighting-ed~ ow...~uses move object on Kent so he's squished in the pile too~

Welcome to the army, SQuigley316! Hm, didn't realise we had 315 other clone troopers out of your batch. All AWOL on us, are they? I'll have to send a battalion to bring them in for court martial.
More seriously, it's cool that you've been following my design diary - please feel free to weigh in with some of your thoughts and ideas! Share the wealth, I say. By the way, if you didn't notice before reading this post, I've added a bit more just now. And definitely follow Tru's Legacy game, we've got some great characters with great dynamics and it's shaping up to be a great story - so, you know, it's pretty great.

Hey! Watchityoo! I'll sick my cat on you! The force is strong with him. Or the flatulence is strong with him. We're usually too overwhelmed by whatever it is to tell which....

### **zerah** (2008-02-15 17:47:39)

~squeals and trys to force sever~ noooo

---

### **thelastfool** (2008-02-15 18:25:50)

The new person doesn't need to know that yet.... ~has his connection to the force severed~ And Samantha you're lucky that I was using the power of the dark side

---

### **zerah** (2008-02-15 21:37:40)

why's that lucky?

---

### **thelastfool** (2008-02-15 22:09:45)

because sever force only works on people who have dark side points and until i started attacking today... i didn't have any
