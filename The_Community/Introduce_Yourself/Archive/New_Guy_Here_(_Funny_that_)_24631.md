# New Guy Here ( Funny that )

### **Anonymous** (2010-04-28 16:11:16)

Hey guys,
I'm Inquisitor Tybalt ( As the name suggests ) however I'm more commonly known to, as Gingusdan, or just Ging. Or even Dan.
Also: Fun fact, I ramble.
A friend of mine linked me to this site because he was running a Dark Heresy RP off the site ( A Play By Post I believe? ) and, since I showed interest, he linked me. Mayhaps I'll expand, beyond my friend's RP.
Well, I am interested mostly in Warhammer 40,000, however was never much of a Tabletop man. I also was interested in background, Role Play and writing my own Fan-Fiction. I'm meant to be fairly good at the three of these but, hey, Beauty's in the Eye of the Beholder, eh?
Guess I will get off the stage now.
Cheers,
Tybalt

Wow, a new guy, welcome <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
I´ve never tried Warhammer 40k, but I´m looking forward to it. I would recommend that you try to give SW Saga a chance as well, it´s a really great game system. Unless you completely lack interest in SW of course, in which case you should just sit tight until my Fantasy Saga conversion is done <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Welcome to GC. You already know I'm a big 40K fan but disturbingly enough I haven't got around to running a DH game until now. Hope you have some fun here . <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

...Well I can't think of a single thing to say that would be funnier or more random that the last two posts. I'll just go sit in the corner and contemplate my meaningless existence. :P
