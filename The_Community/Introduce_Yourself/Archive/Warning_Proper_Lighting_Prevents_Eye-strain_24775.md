# Warning: Proper Lighting Prevents Eye-strain

An introduction, hmm?
Well, my name is Peter but any derivative or butchering of it will get my attention just as well, and for those who have long since forgone the previous lexicon of addressing me, I am referred to as Black Hat for the very simple fact that I do and have worn one in some shape or form and various degrees of erosion for half my life, which would be eleven years, and just as many people tend to just slap them both together . And yes, that was just one run-on sentence for those of you who are now reassessing your preconceptions as to what a rambler really is. No need to thank me for broadening your horizons in that respect, should that be the case, as I'm more than happy to oblige.
I'm an Editor, on top of a laundry list of other things that all capitalize on my ability to sit behind a keyboard and type for extended lengths of time without falling prey to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or Attention Deficit Disorder, and presently work for a local Sci-Fi Magazine though I frequently take on work from anything from The Vancouver Sun to TOR.
I've been both an active player and a GM in dozens of different systems and campaign settings since I became infatuated with it's charming brand of story telling when I was fifteen and first played D&D with some other friends of mine I met at a local Comic Shop and have been playing some sort of campaign weekly since then, and still to this day get together regularly with friends I enjoyed that first game with, even if I did die three times. I actively convert my friends, despite the level of stigma the whole idea brings to them, into playing some sort of Pen and Paper Roleplaying Game, even if I do have to spend years wearing them down with relentless enthusiasm and patience. Some of them have even gone as far as to attempt to build their own systems to better facilitate a genre or play-style that they feel passionately about, which I always do my best to take some time to consult with them on should they need a hand, as I can be remorselessly honest when asked to analyze anything. Though it's the continuously revitalizing love of gaming in general by my friends and my friend's friends that keep me just as interested today as I was when it was all a mystery and the GM would mention THAC0 simply because I was the only player at the table who wasn't privy to it's meaning or relevance.
I really only stumbled upon this place by accident in the references while confirming a few things for the current Saga Edition campaign I'm running that is coming to it's end soon, and figured that this kind of place might yield some benefits to me beyond some fresh and unfamiliar faces.
I look forward to it, whatever *it* may be.
PS: Yeah... that's about as succinct as I get, to be completely honest.

Are those that are scholarly so I don't have to correct myself?
