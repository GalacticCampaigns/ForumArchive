# ~cough~ little late

### **zerah** (2008-02-04 14:56:52)

I um...just kinda realised I've been here for almost a year and never did one of these things >.> And I'm bored before class so I though hey! what the hell lets do this. Right so I'm Sam, chick, just turned 22, umm I'm a psych major in California with a minor in Theatre, use to be theatre major but the school I'm at focuses more on the tech than the acting which isn't fair so I said screw that and moved to psych.
um..I was brought here by DW aka dreamwalker, he introduced me to Alicia's game and my first star wars rp and now I'm in that and his ^^ yay! I'm still learning things, like making my own character sheet by myself..yea haven't done that yet, but I did level one of my characters all by myself! so I take the little things I can ^_^. I'm pretty friendly, I mean I'm not gonna bite your head of or something..well...ok I may bite you but I promise you'll like it =P.
Soooo...yea that's me, I know a few of you already but I hope to get to know everyone ^_^.

Hey! Turn that off! It's hurting my eyes!

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-02-05 18:49:34)

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to light a room is insignificant next to the power of the Dark Side.

### **zerah** (2008-02-05 20:50:06)

~huggles John~

---

### **thelastfool** (2008-02-05 22:34:26)

John, I must learn your ways, for I believe you have much to teach the world.

---

### **zerah** (2008-02-05 22:42:49)

### **thelastfool** (2008-02-05 23:13:49)

Unless of course, Darth Vader happens to be fighting the Energizer Bunny when the batteries in his lightsaber run out.... That's just fate.
