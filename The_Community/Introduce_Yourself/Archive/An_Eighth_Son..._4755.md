... or not. Hello, everyone. I've been playing various Star Wars games for a long while, from the West End Games Star Wars D6 (1E) to D20 to Saga. A friend of mine dragged me over here, and I thought I'd peek on. Nice to meet you all. I hail from a land of ice and snow -- or so it seems right now, being snowed in!
I tend to enjoy both playing and running games and may run at some point here once I get my feet wet.
Anyway -- I'm not good at these introduction posts, so simply: hello!

Hey, I think a simple Hello is perfect for an introduction post!
Flit around, some of the discussions are quite interesting and enjoyable.
Now, I don't know of any PbP games starting up right away. BUuuuUUUUUTTTT here's hoping that changes!
There are also virtual table-tops that are being run, and what have you!
Glad you finally gave in, Octavian!
