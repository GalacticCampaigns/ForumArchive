New to the site, caught a link via the wotc forums. Been playing "star wars" since west end games made me buy 46976947867 d6, big star wars nerd/fan/"that guy". Just looking for a game online to pass some time, meet some new folks and of course game.

YouÂ´ve come to the right place then  <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Welcome, if you are looking for a game, look uner the various "Casting Call" threads, and check the top threads, since theyÂ´re usually the open casts.

Question Number 1. This is basically a multi part questions with multiple choice.
My technologyistism score is about a 2. Sooooo, how does one submit a sheet, where does one get a sheet to submit.
Question Number 2.
Alright, so I don't really have more than one question.

I think I can field this question.
First you just make your character like you normally would. Maybe type it up in word perfect or which ever you prefer. Then find the 'casting call' you want to submit your character to. Hit the 'reply' button for that post and copy and past your character to it.
Its that easy. Just take a look at the different casting calls. You will see a good example in the Rebellion era casting call. Look for the game 'Rebel Dawn".
Hope this answers your question.

There are open calls under the Old Republic and Rise of Empire eras as well. If you are looking for a good format for a character sheet, check out the casting calls like Rowen said, or any active game. ThereÂ´s one standard format that pretty much everyone uses. Take it, replace the details with your own characterÂ´s details, then post.
