# The newest newbie!

### **Anonymous** (2010-05-01 17:38:10)

Hi all!
I'm new to this page and if any games are open I might be up for joining one (provided I like the setting). <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
I'm 30 years old, come from the cold Scandinavia, in particular from Denmark. Currently unemployed, but hoping to find a job in the nearby future (even if it's kinda hard with the economy as it is).
In regards of Star Wars I've played Star Wars D6, Star Wars D20 and Star Wars Saga, so has a bit of knowledge about the system already. My favourite setting must be the Legacy Era, since it provides so much freedom for players to make real changes in the world, while the Old Republic (KOTOR) is also on my favourite list for just the same reason.
In regards of my favourite character types, then I do enjoy <!-- s:sith: -->:<!-- s:sith: --> (lightsaber wielders) quite much, but I've also found it fun to play nobles, soldiers and scoundrels. Only class I find of little interest is the Scout.
Anyway, not sure how much more there is to tell now, so I have just one thing to say: May the Force be with you!

Holy Crap, I´ve been around here for a while, and as far as I can recall there has never been anyone but me from Scandinavia. Too bad you´re from Denmark, but you can´t get it all, can you? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Anyway, if you´re looking for games to join, you should check out the Casting Calls section of the forum. If you see a thread that doesn´t have [Closed] in its title (and isn´t several years old) there´s a good chance that the game is accepting new players, in which case you can always check it out a little further. I only know of one game recruiting right now, and that´s my own game in the Rebellion era, Glory of the Empire.
Anyway, welcome and have fun <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Welcome to GC. Like Anthrax said there is only one Saga game recruiting, but if you're interested in something a little different I have a Dark Heresy game in the recruiting stages too.
Have a nice stay <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I'll think about it. Must admit that I favor Star Wars, since that system/movies have <!-- s:duel: -->:<!-- s:duel: --> <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
Though I must admit that I could be greatly tempted if there was room for a Sister of Battle. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
