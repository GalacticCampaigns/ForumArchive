# Can somebody pass the dice? "Send a droid..."

Hello folks, I'm "insert anything but 'late for dinner'". To be honest I've avoided sites like this for years because a large portion of the enjoy-ability of gaming is hanging out. Unfortunately, gamers with similar schedules and tastes are rarer than shaved homicidal Ewoks with force-pikes in the corridors of derelict star destroyers. So I'm taking my own advice on so many other topics and deciding to try it before I knock it.
As you all can probably tell, I know nothing about this form of RP. I've done mostly table-top, and most of that as a GM cause nobody else would. From the reading I've done so far I get the feeling there's a kindred or couple thousand here bouts, so I think I'm gonna enjoy it here.
I would like to ask for large doses of patience and to be told about any forum faux pas I might make. Thanks in advance to any generous folks here that give me a hand.
Looking forward to many an epic game,
Magical

I started out on OpenRPG a game I got into thanks to the GC and a member who sadly has become lost to us, Cyberpunk.

There are a few open right now that I know of, and if things go as I plan, I´ll be resuming my plans for a Stormtrooper game later this week. Just check around in the Casting Calls section, and look for anything that doesn´t say "Closed"

I would like to add look at casting which don't say closed and have been active in the last couple weeks. Some GMs sadly forget to edit their casting call.
