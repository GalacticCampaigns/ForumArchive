# Hi guys. Guess I'm back.

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-05 15:46:58)

So, life got pretty hectic and before I knew it roleplaying took a back seat. Really far back. It was horrible.
Life still isn't much better, actually, but I'm at the point where I can say to "hell with it" and watch with a certain level of calm as it bears down on me like a berserking rancor.
Anyhoo, Rowan dropped me an email asking if I was even still alive and that some of you guys had expressed concern and I felt rather guilty. Sorry. I'm going to try and get involved in the community again, as I still bear it much love.

Sometimes all you can do is let the rancor have it's way with you, dig yourself out of it's droppings when it's done with you, get cleaned up and move on to the next ravenous rancor...*feels like taking a shower again*...

Welcome back! I have no idea who you are (I joined after you left), but welcome back anyway!

### **Alicia** (2009-06-05 16:25:59)

Welcome back Simply. You were missed!

---

### **Rowen** (2009-06-05 17:27:43)

Man I am so glad your back! All sorts of things were going though my mind ( I think I had tried to send you an email several months ago) and was praying you hadn't been hurt or worse. But I am glad you are safe and can take part in the community once again. I look forward to seeing your elaborate posts and insightful out look on Saga. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Welcome back!!!

Hey there <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> glad to see you found your way back. No worries though real life comes first. I hope everything is all good now we all missed you here.

Hey... I know I think I know this guy!
...Don't you owe me like 50 credits?!
I'm joking Simply, welcome back. Hasn't been the same without you. Heck, if anyone could get a hold of Radon again, we might get the band back together.

### **Yogi** (2009-06-05 21:02:06)

Wb Simply.

Well, I was one of the original members. I think only Rowen, Tru, and a couple of others were around before me (and of those, most disappeared quite quickly). Also happen to have been a moderator alonside Tru before my absence.

Thanks Alicia! Actually, I think I've seen you around, so to speak. Or at least your handiwork. I assume it is the very same Alicia who has helped me get to grips with some of Saga's latest material.

Now I feel really guilty! Should have realised a nurse would be the kind of person to worry! Again, I'm very sorry. Should have dropped you guys a mail to say I was fine at least. Consideration, I'm sorry to say, has never been one of my strongest suits.
Rest assured my writing hasn't changed. You'll be able to see those elaborate posts soon enough. I'm a little rustier when it comes to system design, but I'm sure it'll come back to me.

As mentioned, nothing's really changed, but a few potentially positive steps have been made and I'vel earned to just relax and let things come. Rather like a deer in the proverbial headlights.

Ho.... you're still around too, are you? The yin to my yang, the Shaggy to my Scooby, the Calrissian to my Solo. I missed the oft witty (and occasionaly merely puerile) repartee.
Man, Radon, huh? That'd be an unlikely turn of events, but you wouldn't see me complaining. That's one band that merits a reunion tour.

Thank you.

We didn't usually frequent the same threads but I've been around almost as long as you. Can't wait to see your writings. Most of them I believe have gotten lost in all the database transfers. A real shame really.

So things have changed rather dramatically since I left home. Are there still a main site and chat room, or is the forum the be all and end all these days?

---

### **Alicia** (2009-06-06 00:06:09)

Because of CPU limitations the main site got shut down. There's still a chat room but it's being hosted on my site for the time being. There's generally a good number of people in there so it's fairly active.

Woah, easy with the scrabble-words, Webster. Some of us haven't completed our degrees yet. ;-P
