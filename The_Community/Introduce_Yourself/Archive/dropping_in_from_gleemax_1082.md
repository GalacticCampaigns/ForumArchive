saw the site listed on gleemax, thought I'd look around
I want to play some SAGA, need a GM, so if a game is starting any time soon, PM or email me

good, thanks for the welcome
haven't actually *played* any SAGA games yet, and it's been a while since my last PbP game, so I've crossed my fingers.

welcome to the forums
if youÂ´re looking for a game, keep the "Cating Calls" part of the forums under surveillence, thatÂ´s where GMs seek players for their games
also, you might want to read in on the other games running here, if only to get a feel for how Saga works

Welcome to the forums! Glad you saw my post there (I'm Gith on the wizards forums). DA summed it up nicely. Keep an eye on those casting calls. Eventually After Effects (which is my game) will return for chapter 3. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Hope you have fun here.

I understand the rules for SAGA, I just haven't managed to sit down and play it yet.
I've got some great ideas though, and I'm itchin to try them out.

Hello and welcome to the forums. If you want to pay saga you have come to the right place. There games going on all the time. There are also lots of discussion on otherthings happening with Star Wars. If you have any questions feel to ask.
