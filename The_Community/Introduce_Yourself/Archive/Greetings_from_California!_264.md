Hello and greetings from memember 17! Well I found the new site, it looks good. Doesn't look like my game made it over though? <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
Oh well, just have to keep my eyes open for something new to come along. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Welcome to the forums! The games are trickling in as we speak. Master Tru's game is already in full swing here.

Hello and welcome,
Where about are you in California?
If you are near LA, do you play Star Wars Miniatures?

Southern Cal yes, but sorry don't play the miniatures!

Welcome, Kress!
Run yourself off to the Casting Call topic!
I believe Broken Images is recruiting and I've heard nothing but GOOD about it!
Speaking of which, I need to make my attempt at a character there!
And don't worry! Alot of us have childrenwhich make us feel even older than we are! You're fine!
