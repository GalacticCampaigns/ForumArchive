# Introductions

Hello, all. I've been playing pen and paper for about five or six years, starting with 3.X Dungeons & Dragons. I've always been a fan of RPGs and had been curious about tabletop games before I knew much about them. As soon as I was introduced, I buried myself in the core books and never found my way out. From D&D, I continued with d20 Modern games, Mutants & Masterminds 2nd and now 3rd edition, old and new World of Darkness, Star Wars RCR and Saga edition, 4th edition D&D, the occasional one shot with the indy game of the week (tried Legend of the Five Rings once or twice, made a character in Traveler, etc.). I've used play-by-post forums a few times, but it's been a few years. Looking forward to trying it again.

Welcome to the site. There are a few games recruiting right now, so I think youÂ´ll be able to get started pretty soon.

As someone obviously passionate about a good ol' game, I have very little doubt you'll find yourself worked into the folds and crevices that make up GC, Stranger.
I would also like to suggest that my comrades have obviously been killed and replaced by robots.

Glad you have come to join us!
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). It's very exciting to see another prospective GM in our midst and I know I'm not the only one who will say that I'm excited to see what sort of gaming experience you have brought to our community.
Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not someone will pop in if you linger to meet you.

Thanks for all the welcomes. So far it's been a very pleasant site with very friendly people. I've just gotten into a game in the forums and I may be opening a game of my own in the next few months.
