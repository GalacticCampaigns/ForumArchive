Welcome
As we tell all the newcomers, your first stop should be the Casting Calls, looking for open ones.

Come on in, it is good to see you. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
As DarthAnthrax has said, your first stop (after the introductory post, in any case) should be the various Casting Calls. At any given time there's likely to be one for a new game or an old game looking for new blood open. Generally, if the thread title doesn't have "closed" in it, the game should be open to new applicants.
Different GMs prefer different application processes, but they'll have guidelines for what they expect posted in the casting call. And we're a friendly bunch, so you shouldn't hesitate to ask questions.

For the most part.

Don't ask, it's what they gave me my first time here.

Looks like the back-to-back posting talking up the site has gotten us a couple more members.
I need to remember to do that more often.

Hey there and welcome!
Finding a good open game shouldn't be *too* hard. I've noticed we tend to go in phases. We'll have no games open for a bit, then a bunch will open all at once. You're bound to find something that interests you when the games open.
