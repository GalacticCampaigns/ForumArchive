'Ello,
I'm Jessica, I've been pen and papering for the last 8 years. I started with D&D 3.5 and have gone all over the place since. This is my first play-by-post. I really like Saga Edition and am currently learning Blue Rose.

Hi and welcome.
I´m sure you´ll get the grip on PbP fast, and if you ever have any questions, just ask anyone in here, and they´ll most likely be able to help. Look for games currently recruiting to get you started.

Little known fact: The website actually runs off the spinal fluid of fresh PbPers.
Check with Alicia for a feeding schedule and a pamphlet of self-defense measures.
Yarr.

Glad you have come to join us!
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). It's very exciting to see another prospective GM in our midst and I know I'm not the only one who will say that I'm excited to see what sort of gaming experience you have brought to our community.
Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not someone will pop in if you linger to meet you.
