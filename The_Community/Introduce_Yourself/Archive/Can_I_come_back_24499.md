# Can I come back?

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-09 22:03:49)

Well, my life has settled somewhat as of late, so I thought that I'd see what some of my old friends at GC were up to. After spending some time in the chat room, I thought I'd at least start poking around again.
<looks around the room>
"Can I come back in?"

Korihor! *Goes insane* :P
Great to see you back! You have NO idea how much...smaller this board seems without you around. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

*Kori blushes*
Awwwwww. That's sweet.
*Kori draws his blaster and aims for Zen's chest*
What are you up to? And but the catnip outside! <!-- s:sith: -->:<!-- s:sith: -->

*Ducks away from blaster and extends hidden Assassin's Blade* Oh, you know. The usual.

DK?!?!?!
Man how have you been? Glad to have you back!
*Waves from across the room as he points to the 4 armed Thermal Detonators by Zen's and Dk's feet*

*Looks down* That's what I get for bringing knives to a grenade fight. *Explodes*

Wow, looks like this might be fun. Wonder what MasterSilverback might say?

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-09 22:55:11)

Hey, that's a good point. Are you gonna take over Ariq again, Kor?

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-09 22:58:05)

Didn't know that was even still available. I guess I'd have to talk to Silver.
Hey, Xel. Sauronian.
Wait, I think I'm dead, aren't I? I mean, **4** thermal detonators?
Overkill much?

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-09 23:02:12)

Bah, four grenades is nothing! I'm an Assassin! We always land on our feet! ...Or was that Cathar...?

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-10 00:14:31)

Jeez...you know, if all you people who drop my campaign come back after I recruited newbies, the party's going to be an armored cav regiment. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
Yeah, it's good to have you back, and Ariq's available. Right now Saronian is running him.

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-10 10:35:58)

But that can bring loads of fun for us.
Ah, well, that happens.
Reminds me, gotten distracted from the new round I see? <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: --> <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Yeah, sorry. Working on it shortly. I kid you not, we are still digging out here...somewhere around 15 inches of wet snow, followed by single digit temps and massive wind chill.
But, at least my Packers took care of business Monday night. <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-10 12:21:20)

Damn. Well, I'd still take that for a little while over what did over two years ago when I was deployed.
For a little while, I said.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-10 17:05:06)

Well, Silver, if you want me to take over Ariq again, let me know. I can post about once a day or so.

Aw. I had such high hopes and plans for him.
Oh well, I'm good with it from my perspective.

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-10 19:40:15)

*quickly backs up*
No, no, no, no. Sauronian, take him. I thought Silver wanted me to take Ariq back, but I'm honestly not really feeling up to taking on more characters right now. I think that the one I applied to Zen's campaign should be enough for now. I don't really want more on my plate at the moment.
So, I'd like to read what you're doing with Ariq, sit back, and enjoy the show. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

...O.O Are you really the same Darth_Korihor? The crazy nutcase that took on five characters and two campaigns at once?

I'll submit some ideas over to you, mostly for your input. I'm thinking about taking advantage of the Martial Arts feats in GaW book after getting a Force Feat (seriously, that's one reason for taking the Force).
Any way, how do feel this going for now?

Nope. Killed 'em dead. I'm in an attempt at the moment to balance the many sides of my life; father, husband, teacher, believer, game player, and game master. It was the overload that I think lead to my previous withdrawal. Since I don't wish to repeat the process, I'm taking it slow.
As to how busy my gaming life is at the moment, I GM M&M twice a month, I DM D&D once a week at school (the gaming club has its faithfuls), and I currently LARP twice a month for Vampire: the Requiem. So, just trying to not overkill it.
The attempt will most likely end soon and I'll overload myself fairly quickly. <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->

I'd have to read up on what's happened since I left to answer that question. However, when I got my hands on GAW, I immediately went to the Martial Artist section and drooled over the possibilities. Good times.

I hear ya. I'm trying to decide between taking the Echani Feat, Force Training, or the Martial Arts 2 or multiclassing for Evasion.
As for what's been happening, not a whole lot. Just waiting for MasterSilverback to post the next round.

Do you leave near me? Because that's exactly what it's like outside here. Still, the plows did a nice job of clearing the streets, so it's not so bad.
Oh, and welcome back, Korihor! Because, you know, that's what I was here for before I got distracted.

*waves at MoDa*
Thanks for the welcome back.

Hey Kor. You going to start your game back up. I still have Jace ready to go. Welcome back man.

Of course I don't live near you, your location blurb says you're in the Kalium Galaxy!
Seriously, though, I live in Freeport, IL. And this weather's still not as bad as what I put up with when the wife was stationed at Fort Drum. (Shudder!)

I don't know, Ganth. I don't want to overextend myself and then let others down again. Time will tell.
