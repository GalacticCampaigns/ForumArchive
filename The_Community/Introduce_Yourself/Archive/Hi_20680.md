# Hi

Just thought I'd say hi. This place was recommended as a place to run my Star Wars Saga RPG.
It's Infinities and as such doesn't fit into the "eras", though Rebellion Era best fits the feel of the setting.
So, I guess the dumb question is, what formalities do I have to go through before I can start?

welcome new person
you have to post a casting call in the general time of the game. and then once everything is ready you ask Rowen (the administrator) to make a forum for your game, and give all the players permission to post in the game.
looking forward to when your game starts <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Welcome to the forum!
Normally you would take the steps SacredPhoenix stated in his reply. However, you may wish to wait until the site is redesigned before starting your game. I am almost finished with the reconstruction and once that is finished everyone will be able to sign up at that site. Ill be giving everyone about a week to back up anything from this forum before shutting it down for the combined site.
Hope that doesn't deter your enthusiasm for the site! I look forward to another GM to start a game. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Welcome aboard!

That's not the end of the world.
A week to select character candidates and get the plot ready, just not actually start until the new place.
I can work with that.

Hey Zoe welcome to the site <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> For formalities I would suggest ducking or dropping cat nip before zerah tackles you. :
As SacredPhoenix stated Rowen can setup a game for you, as can I. We can also address any issues you might have with your game.

Funny you should mention catnip.

~eyes the person from the shadows, tackles, grabs the catnip, eyes again, then curls up between Ro and Tru~ hi.

Lucky I'm not here as Mist, otherwise I'd have eaten the catnip and gone hyper. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Welcome. I see you met zerah. Try to make her stay off the furniture, and keep a spray bottle handy and everyone'll be okay. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
