# Absolut Evil

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-15 20:51:50)

*Walks in and bows then looks up with a twisted smile* I'm going to be very clear I may be new here but I'm not new to role playing. You may call me Absolute, I will not post any information about my real life on here. My online life and real life are two different lives that do not coexistent . Not trying to sound cold just letting everyone know that I keep them separate . I do hope that I can get along with as many of you that I can and those that I can not get along with. Well to each their own

Evil camp? I have never been to such a camp I just grew up with a twisted sense of justice. It did not take long for that to get twisted to the point that some people say I practice cruel and unusual punishment daily.

Oh! You're a teacher too? ;D
Welcome Brother!

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-15 21:39:58)

I am no teacher. I drag the unwilling behind me letting them taste the carnage I leave in my wake until they break. *twisted smile*

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-15 21:47:18)

Sooo, teacher? After all, that's what I do. Well, that and laugh maliciously when they scream in agony.

He who calls himself absolute evil has obviously never met me.
Welcome, in any case.

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-16 14:19:34)

Well you have not met me so you do not know how cruel I can really be *smiles*

Is everyone on this site unnecessarily evil? Did I join the "evil roleplayer's forum" without knowing it? Though I shouldn't talk, as one of my characters just brutally murdered someone a day or two back. Either way, welcome, fellow Mega Man lover! <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-17 16:26:14)

I am not unnecessarily evil, nor did I say I was evil. I said I was on the edge of pure evil. After all are good and evil separated by a sold line? Or does one fade into the other changing at the slightest push or turn of events?
