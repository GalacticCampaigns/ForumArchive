Hey gang,
I've been poking around the site as a guest for a little bit and I've finally decided to introduce myself ^_^
All of my Star Wars RP experience (both playing and GMing) has been with the West End Games system. I've been neck deep in D6's since about 1993 and I'm still running games. I have the SAGA book but my players all want to stick to the D6 system so I'll have to get my d20 Star Wars experience here on the internet.
So... uhh... where can I sign up for a game? :

:P
Just boot around the forums, in particular the Casting Calls threads. You can find them in the different gaming forums. "Old Repulic Era PbP Games" for example.

Nice to have you here! Glad you decided to become a member too. Bob pretty much summed it up nicely, just keep an eye on the casting calls and when someone starts a game you submit a character. Its pretty simply really, on the other hand you can also run a game if you choose. Just have to create a casting call in the appropriate forum and as one of us Admins to create the forum for you.
On that note, have fun!

Great to have a new person. Hello I am Ganthet. I don't know if there are any Casting calls right now but it never hurts to look. Sometimes gamers leave games and the GM will ask for others to tke there place. Just keep looking you will find something. Well later man hope to see you in game.

Hello there new guy, West End Games? Wow, I remember the first days of Star Wars using those d6's hehe. Reminds me too much of Shadowrun <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->). I think you will enjoy Saga edition, its a much improved system with its own flaws.
