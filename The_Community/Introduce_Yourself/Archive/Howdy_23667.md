Hi there. I'm a new GM for saga, but I would love to play. Unfortunately, my gamers are unlikely to pick up the mantle. I've never played a pbp game, so I'd love some pointers. I can play just about any type of character if anyone's looking for a player. I'd love to play a gun-toting meat-wall. If anyone has a game and is willing to hold the hand of a pbp newbie, give me a ring at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:jptarus@hotmail.com">jptarus@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->. Thanks.

Hello there and welcome to the site <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> There are several games running all with different styles the best advise I could give would be to find the style you like the most. Games come up every so often or you might even get into one of the existing games. Good luck <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Welcome to the site! For games check out the Casting Call section of each era to see who is looking for players. Its the system we developed here to let members know a GM is looking for players (or spot fills).
As for GMing I would say read this for starters: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php? &#8230; &amp;Itemid=59](http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30&Itemid=59 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30&Itemid=59")<!-- m -->
It will give you a general idea of what to look for. Then find some on going games and see how other GM's run there pbp. Its a bit easier to run than a live game due to the pace, which is great for when your first learning.
If you have any other questions just ask we have a great community here!
