Hey I hope you are all finding the new site well, thanks for coming over I know how change can be hard at times. I never really introduced myself at the last site so here I go.
I am 100% Canadian and dam proud to be, easily one of the best countries in the world. I am 31 years old (don`t hold that against me <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ) I have been married for 13 years now. I have 2 wonderful children, daughter age 6 and son age 2. I work for ATT wireless so it any of you in the states have a blackberry we may already have spoken.
Anyway I have been an active member of this forum since the start, I am a huge star wars and DnD fan and I look forward to alot of good gaming with you guys.
