Hello. My name is Amanda, I'm 24 years old and I'm from Australia. I got into roleplaying about 2 years ago. I've never done pbp roleplaying before, so I hope that you can all put up with my noobish questions (if you haven't already answered. Did you know you guys have like 5000+ questions answered already, and I only looked at like 10% of this whole site?)

Welcome to the site Amanda. Feel free to ask any questions that you may have. For the most part we're pretty harmless. There are still some Casting Calls that are still open so feel free to check those out. I also think you're our only member from Australia so congrats on that. Time differences with holding there are generally people in the chat room through out the day

Welcome
Since he pretty much got everything covered, IÂ´ll just second everything Yogi said. If you have any questions, just ask them.

Welcome! Afraid Dave was wrong about one thing. You're not the first Aussie to pass through here though you're our first female Australian! (Still first!)
Hope you enjoy your stay with us and feel free to pop into the chat!

So an Australian has come to our den
To forgo the paper and pen
Let's see what she's got
I hope it's a lot
But that's all just a matter of when
Bonjour, Ola, and Hey from the desolate and lifeless wasteland of the Canadian Arctic.
Courir aussi vite que vous pouvez
