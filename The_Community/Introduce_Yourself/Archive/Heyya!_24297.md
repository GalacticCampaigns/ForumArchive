Hi, the name's Craz. We'll leave it at that for now. ^_^
I'm a long time RPer, been rolling dice since Christian Camp in 2004 with D&D 3.5. Yea, bad call on their part. I'm a librarian aide by day, writer by night, and geek 24/7. Now, I prefer games with a good plot behind them, but hey, I'm open to ideas. Games recruiting? Gimme a yell.

Just keep an eye on the Casting Calls for the various eras of play. By the by, I'm currently recruiting for my Rebel Cell game in the Rebellion Era. We still have one slot open.
