Hello my name is Curtis and am hoping to start playing. My normal group is in my home state of NH while I'm in Cali attending school. So hope to see every one or at least a good group.

Welcome to the forums! Games tend to spring up quick around here. Keep an eye out for a "Casting Call" in that section of the forum and be ready to submit a character.
Hope you have a great time here!
