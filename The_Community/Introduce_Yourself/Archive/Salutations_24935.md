Hello. I'm unknownmercury. I joined this site because I need a place to host my only D&D games. This was the best place I could find.

Welcome! As I've already seen you in the chat room I would just like to add that it's great to have an influx of GMs. D&D is also a game we're currently lacking the closest proximally being Pathfinder.
When you're ready to run, feel free to set up a Casting Call and request a forum!
Should you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.

Welcome
IÂ´ve had a couple of runs with D&D in the past, but none that really took off, so I would definitely be interested in giving it a new shot.
