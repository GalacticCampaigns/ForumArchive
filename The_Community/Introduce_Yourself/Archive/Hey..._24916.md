Hello Everybody!
My name is SuperBall. I've been running Star Wars Saga Edition since it first came out, along with other sci-fi rpgs like Mongoose Traveller. I've only recently become a player of this wonderful system. Once in my actual tabletop group, and an online PbP DoD campaign on the DL Nexus. I'm really looking forward to getting involved in the community as both a player and a GM!

Welcome and be merry, SuperBall, for you are among kindred spirits hell-bent on your enjoyment of this site.
My name is Pete, and I am both trustworthy and passionately anti-limerick.

Welcome SB, Glad you have come to join us!
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). It's very exciting to see another prospective GM in our midst and I know I'm not the only one who will say that I'm excited to see what sort of gaming experience you have brought to our community.
Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not someone will pop in if you linger to meet you.
