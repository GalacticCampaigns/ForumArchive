# New player. Looking for any style of Saga game.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-21 12:37:25)

Hey guys. Just wanted to do a quick introduction and offer up myself for any kind of Saga game.
I'll be keeping my eyes open for anything but if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be cool.
I have experience with PbP and Star Wars RPG in general. I have not played Saga but played alot of RCR style back in the day. I would love to venture into Saga because it doesn't seem to be too far off from what RCR was but with some for the better updates.
So that is me in a nutshell and I am absolutely excited to be getting back into SWRPG.

Welcome to the site. Keep an eye on the Casting call sections for each era. That is where new games are announced. I don't think there are any casting calls going on right now. There have been two game that have recently lost players so maybe those two will be looking for players.
Keep an eye out.
Again welcome to the site.
