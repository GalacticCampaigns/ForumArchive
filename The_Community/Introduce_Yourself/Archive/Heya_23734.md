Hi, I'm kenad. I live in Southampton, UK, where I study physics and astronomy.
I've been avidly collecting the Saga books ever since it came out, and indeed I started on my [character sheet](http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=866480 "http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=866480") before I even had the core book. However, despite once having had an occasional group for the RCR, I stand no chance of having one now. So I'd love to join in with the fun here.
I hope to be one of the grizzled old vets welcoming newbies like me in no time  <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Wow, people here sure are friendly. :o
I don't have any catnip, I'm afraid, but I do have a bell on the end of a string. Will that suffice?

Welcome here, and by the Force, donÂ´t tease her with a bell...

*Freakin'* "Hi" #4
Too many folks sneak in as soon as they heard I was leaving for a bit.  You see this?  Now *that's* a reputation!
...or is could be I need to do laundry.

Is that a rhetorical question?  ;D
Welcome, new person.  When zerah comes at you like that, just threaten to give her a bath.
