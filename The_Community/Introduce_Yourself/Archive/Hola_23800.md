Yeah, People! WOO!
So anyone explain to me how to get into a Republic Commando game?
Grabs person who tackles and give them a Keldabe Handshake.

Well, getting in one is pretty simple.
Find a game with an open spot, make up a character and talk to the GM and things should solve themselves.
The hard part is to find a game with an open spot with a GM who wants another player.
Anyway, welcome to the forums.
