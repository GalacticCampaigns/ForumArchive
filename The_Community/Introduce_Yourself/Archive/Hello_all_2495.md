Just a little thread to say hi and tell y'all a bit about me.
I'm a history/cultural anthropology student in RL, also heavily involved in music (but not as in "heavy" music :p )
What concerns RP-ing i've been playing about 5 years, started out with DnD Forgotten Realms; since it's introductio n i switched to Eberron.
DnD is currently inactive until 4th edition arrives, and then i'll see if i'll be continuing that.
I've played in StarWars Living Force until it's conclusion and recently i've picked up SAGA-edition and i'm looking forward to playing with you all.
As for Star Wars itself, i was introduced to it when i was just 4 years old, even before the "Special Edition" was out. (i'm 19 now so go figure)
The movies itself were mostly popular with a then womewhat older audience but i was introduced by my 14 year older cousin. He had everything and all relating to those movies and some of that fandom proved to be contageous...
So that's me, and who are YOU ?
May the Force be with you all.

Welcome, and all that.
I'm the forum's current nay-sayer, with the least sociable attitude. Everyone one else is quite pleasant, and easy to get along with. So enjoy.
