Achuta, my pee kasa Sketchpad ... or in other words, howdy, I'm Sketchpad <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> I found a link here from the WotC boards and figured I'd take a look. I'm a big fan of Star Wars and have dug gaming in every variant of the rules (from d6 to Saga). Currently, I'm running a campaign during the Dark Times between Episodes III & IV and plan on doing a PbP campaigns set in the KOTOR era. Looking forward to some good conversations here. So, to quote an Ewok I once ran into ... Gyeesh, chak heeta hutah.

Welcome.
There was just a casting call closed for the KOTOR era I think, but IÂ´m running a game in that era if you want to check it out.

Hey Sketch welcome to the forums. It's Smitty, I knew you would find your way here.
At least I hope you are who I think you are.
Checked your AIM handle. I was right.

Hello. Welcome to the site. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> If you still wanted to get into my Kotor game, I'm willing to accept bribes.
Good Idea Rowen. *holds out cat nip, as well*

Thanks for the ...er ..warm welcome gang <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->. Not sure if I want to play or run at this time ... figured I'd see how the community is and, if all goes well, may start running some games. I'm still itching to run some KOTOR and maybe some Rebellion era after this summer <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> I've been working on a few fan-campaign guides for the games I want to run, and have also done a few conversions at my blog (click on my sig to go there). We'll see how things go ...
