# Valheru Returns

### **Valheru** (2010-06-15 16:17:37)

Hey folks, after a long and unexplained absence I'm back! To those of you whose games I left hanging I can only offer my apologies. I know it's frustrating to have players dip in and out and I have no excuse really. I hope all can be forgiven but if not I'll bear you no ill will. I'd love to get back in the swing of things and I promise, no more vanishing acts!

Thanks, I wasn't sure where this post should go since I'm **re**introducing myself. :P
