# Hello Everyone! ^^

### **Avarna** (2009-01-14 18:00:38)

Hello. I'm Avarna.
I'm an experienced Role-player, and have all the Saga Edition books that have been released to date. I try to set up actual table top games as often as I can, but have trouble getting people to see eye to eye. I work at a tool store in the northern US.
So... That's about it for now.
