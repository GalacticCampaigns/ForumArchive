# HEY I Have Returned....Wait you don\'t know me?

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-29 22:50:54)

HEY EVERYBODY! Well You may or may not have guess it by now but I am someone you once new!
*Drums Roll* Xeladin = Xandiel!!! OH SNAP!
Yeah anyways to explain where I have been, well I became unemployed so I didn't have cash and no cash means no internet...*tears* and I was also having Health Issues, like blood coming from behind the eye, but I is all fixed though I for the life of me could not remember any of my old account stuff, somewhat of memory loss but I remembered the site and I am doing good again so I made a new account! Though considering I have been gone awhile I suppose I have been removed from the games (Great ones from Sacred and Frost!)
SO ummm what did I miss and did anyone miss me?

Thank you, glad to be back! Ya know I guess I should have but I had assumed that by now I was removed from most, if not all, games I was in so I figured start anew but if you would prefer I can do that! :
By the way I wasn't sure where to look Rowen, but I have been working on a Campaign of my own during my down time and I think I am gonna try to GM for the First Time, so any heads up or hints? (Anybody with some hints feel free to add your wisdom) :P

Xeladin!! I am so glad you are back! You are the MAN!!
If I ever had to set up an attack run down the trench of a super-laser equipped space station that was on the verge of destroying a moon full of people I had just met, I would want you as my wingman!
Actually, I have no clue who you are.... but you do know how to fly an X-Wing, right? You see, there is this space station with this laser... oh, nevermind...
Welcome Back!!
