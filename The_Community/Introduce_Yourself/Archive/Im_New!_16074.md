### **Anonymous** (2008-09-04 00:51:22)

Hello everyone, I just found myself in a situation were rpging cant be possible with my groups
So this play by post stuff is new and exciting for me.
I hope i can join a session with some of u guys and ill pm the gm's if its ok.
I was attracted to this site mostly because of the high posts per day as i saw in a game going on right now and Ive applied at the saga edition web site but there very inactive so far and not many posts go up over there.
I visit wizards often and own all the books, gm my own games in my area north of chicago and I would really like to try the online way.
So plz be gentle and dont complain about my spelling. its not going to improve
