# Lorsic Failed Jedi - Says Hello

### **Anonymous** (2007-09-25 08:54:51)

Sup Everyone,
Ran into a post on wizards Star Wars section, thought I would sign up on the forum.
I play Star Wars Miniatures, and I finally got started on my Star Wars Saga campaign. We just had our first very successful session Sunday.
We are in the South Bay Area of California, LA.
Got a nice group of five players, and I am GM'n. So I figured I could use this forum for questions with people who are mature and hopefully helpful with questions I may have. I will definitely share my knowledge and opinions when I have the time.
Look for my posts!
