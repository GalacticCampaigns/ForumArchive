Another new guy here. Signed up largely because I don't know of many people in my area who roleplay. Starting out as a player, I may start GMing an infinities campaign I've been cooking up.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 09:41:55)

It's somewhat gratifying to see that someone else is already doing the hyper cat-girl thing here so I don't have to.
*holds a sugar mouse full of catnip out for Zerah*

### **zerah** (2008-11-14 18:57:56)
