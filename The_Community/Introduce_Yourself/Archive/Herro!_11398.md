Hello fellow interwebians!
I've been trying to convince my friends to play some Star Wars RPG for awhile now, but unfortunately they're rather jaded after our horrible attempts at D&D 3.5, so I figured I'd come here and try my luck.
I've never actually played any Star Wars rpg, except an old free form play by post game from like 1998. But I'm learning quickly! Cheers.
