They've all pretty much been done.
I've been browsing around for some type of SW PbP for awhile. Jackpot! I love google.
I go by Ramza, being paranoid about my real name.

But we don't have a door! :P
Or a coat rack, or even a hat stand! That, and this is all online! :P

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-24 06:49:36)

### **zerah** (2008-06-24 19:25:52)

~glares~ I don't get the padded room anymore remember? I shreaded it ^_^

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-25 01:00:00)

i think we put mando steel behind all that padding.

---

### **thelastfool** (2008-06-25 01:56:48)

Oh... thats right sorry I forgot... and they won't repair it until next month... so what should I do with you until then?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-25 07:05:46)

Lock her in the dryer and turn it on maybe? Then she can run off some of that energy? Make sure you put in some dryer sheets tho.... we do NOT want her getting all static-y....

---

### **zerah** (2008-06-27 01:57:12)

nooooooooooooooooooooo no dryer!!! Kent don't do it please ;.;

### **thelastfool** (2008-06-27 19:18:26)

I won't do that do you... I guess I'll just have to keep you on your leash until I think of something. ~walks off with Zerah~
