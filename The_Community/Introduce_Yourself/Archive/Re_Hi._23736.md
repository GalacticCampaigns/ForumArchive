Hehe, there has been a lot of new people here today  <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> *tosses the obligatory bag of catnip*
YouÂ´ll find that SAGA is, IMO, a very good system, and while I donÂ´t have much eperience with earlier versions, I dare to say it is superior in many ways.
But your are out of date, you are missing both *The Force Unleashed Guide* and *Scum and Villainy*, and theyÂ´ll soon be releasing a book about the Clone Wars  ;D
