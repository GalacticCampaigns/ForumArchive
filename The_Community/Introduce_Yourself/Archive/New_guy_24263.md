*being quite internet savy, took the time to scout the forum first and prepared a waterballoon with catnip trap*
So I guess I'm new (no kidding), I've been in search of a dedicated starwars pbp forum for quite some times and I found this.
I'm 23 and quite interested into playing pbp due to the fact that live game are all but impossible for me (I blame the lack of gamers in this country).
I hope we will all go along well.

The link is at the top of the page, where it says 'chat' <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->.
Welcome to GC anyway, probably want a water pistol or something I assume?

Welcome!
There's also a few of us who have a banner in our signatures with the link.
If it doesn't work at first just refresh. It tends to be a littler temperamental.

Welcome! Check out the chat as has previously been mentioned. Hope you enjoy the games here. Just check out the casting calls for the era you feel like playing in.
