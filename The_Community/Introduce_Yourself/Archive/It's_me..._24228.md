I'm Xychotic.
For me, plausibility is the most important part of the game. Then fairness/balance. Story is last, but only because I think story flows from plausibility and balance.
I'm one of those people that, for the most part, hates the execution of Star Wars, but absolutely loves the idea. If you don't get what I mean, then you need to reread this: <!-- m -->[http://www.jivemagazine.com/column.php?pid=3381](http://www.jivemagazine.com/column.php?pid=3381 "http://www.jivemagazine.com/column.php?pid=3381")<!-- m -->
That's about all I have to say. Hi folks. Please try not to ignore me.

Welcome aboard.
As to plausibility, what do you think we are, logical? Please. We're insane here.
Seriously, though, if you want to make sure the games are what you're looking for, check them out before you play one.
