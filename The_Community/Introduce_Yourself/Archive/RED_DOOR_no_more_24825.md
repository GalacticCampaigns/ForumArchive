# RED DOOR no more

### **Anonymous** (2010-10-20 00:27:28)

Hello. Some of you may remember me, I used to go by the tag RED DOOR. I am back, but I am now using Dorsay. Seems to be a bland reintroduction... <!-- s:trooper: -->:<!-- s:trooper: -->

An overly large grin supports the uncertain look on the rest of Dorsay's face. "Yes happy, verrryy happy." His eyes widen and his smile turns to a large round hole as a flimsy bag of catnip hits him in the chest. "Oh crap!"

~Scampers in to the call and the smell of catnip, promptly tackles the non-red door name that is still the same person and therefore not new~ Hello again ^^ glad you're back ~hugs, grabs the bag, and promptly tackles Yogi to play with said catnip on the Yogi-Mattress, every kitty's favorite type~

This is kinda creepy, nice one though. Imagine if you will, a large Feline biped sitting on the edge of a well, looking down at you. In his or her hands, EO for freaky people right, is a very young Bothan who seems to be enjoying the petting.
...or else it gets the hose again <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> .
Hello Zerah! Can I sit on the Yogi too?

### **zerah** (2010-10-23 03:10:05)

My Yogi >.<....hmm...but for a stuffed bunny plush toy I'll let you near him. ^^

Vapid.

Great I've become a mattress. Though I can think of worse things. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
