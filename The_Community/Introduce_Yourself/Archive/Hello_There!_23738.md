;D
The title says it all. I'm a pretty new PnP Player and always having problems finding a gorup in my Area. Grew up on the West Coast and now Live on the East, So the Folks I played some of the other games with are now seperated by about 3000 miles from me.
Just Wanted To drop in and say hello 8)

<!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->* Welcome!  Watch out for zerah.  We're reasonably sure she's had all her shots, but one can never be too careful....
If you see here, use this!  *Hands him a fire hose*

**Walks in with drink in his hand.* Hello I see you have met zerah. (tosses her a bag of catnip.) The bar is over here and I was think of the large screen of there with the 360. Yay we'll get this place fixed up nicely.
