> &#8230;and look forward to meeting some new friends&#8230;

You will not find any friends here. They are all cultists here, practicing their bizarre religion, conducting perverse rituals, and stealing everyone's Oreos. I would warn you to stay away, but it too late for you the moment you posted. Scribe and Rowan have all your information, from where you live to your favorite type of car. Their insidious computer program has flooded your brain with subliminal suggestions, inducting you in to their dark arts. And should you resist their subtle controls, they will send their enforcer, Zerah, after you, who, in the guise of cuddling, with stab you with poisoned needles, stucking your will and turning you into a mind slave.
Alas, it is far to late for you, indeed.
