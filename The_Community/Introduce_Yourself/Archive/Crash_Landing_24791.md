*looks around aimlessly*
So...I just stumbled upon this site, and I haven't been able to get an rpg group together for a little over a year. I miss it terribly, but I have never experienced a real play by post game. Needless to say, I am new here - my name is Jarrod.

Welcome Jarrod!
Feel free to take a look around at some of the games. As it is in face to face games, each GM has a different style in how they run their games.
Take a look at the casting calls, there's some games opening up/ recruiting at the moment.
Also feel free to join us in the chat room. If you have any questions any one there will be more than willing to help you out.

Hi and welcome.
If you´re looking for games, we currently have a very high rate of open casting calls right now, so be sure to check them all out. I´ve got one open in the Rebellion Era in case you feel like being a soldier for a while.
Oh, and get rid of that cake...fast!

Hey Jarrod, welcome to the site

### **Magical2099** (2010-09-01 18:27:45)

Ooops. Yeah, forget I said anything about the super secret ingredient and ignore DA, you just hold on to that cake as if your life depended on it, okay?

Really nice to meet you Jarrod, I'm the last new guy.
Ultimate place is more like it, Yogi.
Now be a doll, Jarrod, and just read the first letter in these three sentences.
