Hello everybody!
I wanted to introduce myself all proper and such. Well actually I guess a reintroduction? For those who may remember me as Xeladin. I probably owe a few people apologies as well as I probably disappeared suddenly and such...well long story short it was a pretty bad year....computer fire....kitchen fire....car fire....pretty much a pyromaniacs sorta of pleasurable year...anyways I'm hoping everyone is ok with me coming back and accepts my apology for any grief or issues I may have caused. <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: -->
How is everyone?
