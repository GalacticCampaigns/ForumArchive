# Nice to meet you.  Got a game?

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-12 17:56:46)

This feels a little like SWRPG speed dating.
"Hi there. My handle's Darklighter. My resume includes various appearances in D6 games, a few spins through RCR games, and a couple of dalliances with the SAGA edition. I'm experienced with play-by-post, and am averse to one-line responses. My favourite colour is green. Can I buy you a lum? Maybe we can hook up later for a game..."

Korihor walks in and sits down at the table.
"Hi, my name is Korihor. I run a game and play in like 10 others right now. I'm a Taurus and prefer to play either the tank or the skill monkey."
*DING!*
"Well, see you later."
Korihor drops a catnip bomb on the table.
"Enjoy!"

### **Alicia** (2009-07-12 18:06:23)

hehe! Welcome!
*Hands the newcomer a water pistol.*
You may need this.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-12 18:25:59)

*Darklighter looks at the the catnip bomb and his eyes widen. He quickly slaps the bomb into the air lock and kicks the door closed. A concussive boom follows. Strays begin rubbing against the airlock door and meowing plaintively. Darklighter looks down at his date card.
"Bad date," he says, and crosses Darth_Korihor off his list.
Someone new arrived and put a water pistol in front of him
"Wha.. water pistol?" he said dumbly, picking the thing up.
He looks Angela up and down.
"I'm disinclined to use this. The last thing I want to tell someone is that they're all wet."

### **Alicia** (2009-07-12 18:33:12)

Angela? ....

Hey there and welcome to the site

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-12 19:05:15)

Oh, trust me. Keep the water pistol. You'll want it when zerah gets here.
Welcome, by the way.

---

### **Rowen** (2009-07-12 19:23:52)

Welcome to the site. <Looks at the water pistol> Yeah, might want to keep that. Just trust us. <Grins>

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-07-12 20:41:12)

Welcome. Oh, and if Korihor says anything about me...or anything stupid...or...anything at all, feel free to ignore him. It's what we all do. :P

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-12 21:02:56)

Korihor plans to set one of Shiv's vibroblades to self destruct mode soon.
Sor'll have a heart attack.
Rusty'll get shot.
And Ariq won't save Artreth any more. :o
*bounces on the balls of his feet from side to side*
"You wanna piece little boy? Huh?"
Dorn suddenly finds a lightsaber through his chest. "Dang!"

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-07-12 21:13:41)

Yeah, here's the thing: You can kill Sor easily since you rule the universe in that game. In all the others, I get to fight back. Droid vs Human? I pick the Droid. Saber-wielding Jedi vs Martial Artist? I pick the Jedi. Master of Bladed Weaponry vs Mechanic? I pick the Master of Bladed Weaponry. Of course I AM biased, but...
Oh, and Dorn would suffer a LOT worse than a lightsaber wound. Can anyone say "Rakghoul Disease?" <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> :P

*Darklighter looks at her name tag, and his head hits the table as an expression of stupidity.*
"Sorry about that, Alicia. Speed dating, you know? Getting it wrong in record time," he explains.
*Beside his *own* name, he writes, "Bad date."*
Thanks for the welcome, everyone. Happy to meet you, and with the help of your 'heads up' warnings, I'll do my best to respond appropriately. 'Name dyslexia' is occasionally a quirk of mine, as I have already demonstrated to my chagrin. Oh, how we're getting to know each other! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
So, should I ask about Zerah and water pistols? In the meantime, I think maybe I'll just step over here and fill this thing...

### **Yogi** (2009-07-12 23:30:48)

Welcome.
Darklighter huh. Would this be the same Darklighter that was over at roleplayinggames.net. Played a few games with Neoreality and JediBigSal? If so I'm the latter of the two.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-13 03:31:40)

Zerah is the resident catgirl.

Hey there and welcome!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-13 18:07:14)

Welcome
If you are up for a game that isnÂ´t SAGA, check the General RPG forums, simply has got some cool things starting up there.

JediBigSal! Good to see you! I remembered you telling me about this place, and finally decided to drop by and join up. For those that don't know, Yogi and I go back a few years to some excellent roleplaying on the aforementioned site. We played off each other well. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
*Suddenly, Darklighter is bowled over by meowing blur, words of welcoming ringing in his ears. As the blur moves off to break up a dispute, he picks himself up, dusts off his vacuum suit, and tips his helmet to zerah.*
"A pleasure to make your acquaintance," he says. He looks at the water pistol and shrugs his shoulders. Too late to use this, he thinks, and so he stuffs it in his belt.
Thanks for the invite, DarthAnthrax. I'll check it out.

*Darklighter's eyes follow the wolf-like being.*
"Well, thank you kind, uh... sir dog?"
*He shrugs with some relief. He passed the sniff test.*
So I've been checking the boards every day. Any chance anyone needs another engaging character of some sort for a Star Wars game? No early lines and call for cast members?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-21 06:38:24)

I might have an opening for you in my Old Republic era game. I was thinking of letting in another character too keep my player count at 5-6.
I will probably be a little while before I can insert you into the story as the players are currently in a situation where it would make no sense to meet anyone who isnÂ´t a Mandalorian. And that also happens to be the only character concept not allowed in the game. Read the gameÂ´s description and youÂ´ll understand why. I expect them to finish it pretty soon, but that all depends on how fast they post :P
Anyway, if you are interested, take a look at it. The game uses a new ruleset I made up some time ago, and it might require some look into to understand. You can find a thread with the current rules in the game forum (although itÂ´s undergoing a massive cleaning up) where you can read up and familiarize with it.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-21 20:29:14)

DarthAnthrax, thanks very much! I see you're running two games in the Old Republic era: Flames of War; and Paths of Corruption. Which one may have the opening?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-21 20:33:41)

IÂ´m only running one of them, Flames of War. The other one is run by zenkatarn. You might be confused as I am listed as moderator of both games.
IÂ´m planning on reopening the casting call soon, just as soon as I can settle on some in-game details. IÂ´ll probably be looking for 1-2 new characters to join, so if youÂ´re interested, check it out. What turns many applicants off is the new Force system. Some people like it, some donÂ´t, and thatÂ´s pretty much it. Me, I like it (duh), and wants to play with it and continuously improve it.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-21 21:10:05)

I'll read up, and watch for that casting call. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
