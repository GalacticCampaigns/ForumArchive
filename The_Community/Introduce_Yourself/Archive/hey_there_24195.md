Welcome to the Boards. Resistance is futile. Prepare to be asinine.
Can any one guess the quote?

Welcome to the forums! <tosses a few kitty toys to the ground> Everyone is so afraid......can't imagine why.

Welcome to the forums! And, don't worry about all the stuff about catnip and cat toys. There's nothing to worry ... ...
*Korihor hears a sound, the light crunch of leaves behind him. He knows that sound, and it reminds him of the sounds souls make when they are wrenched from their bodies. Time slows to a crawl as his head turns to catch a glance at what's behind him, even though everyone in the theater audience is screaming, "Don't turn around you idiot! Run! Run you stupid white boy run!" However, Korihor turns anyway, and sees her. Zerah. Trying to turn back in the other direction, knowing he won't make it in time, Korihor's vastly underdeveloped legs begin pumping in a futile attempt to escape the horror on paws running behind him. The shadows swarm around him for a second, and Korihor turns again, only to trip on a tree root in the path.
Falling to the ground, Korihor screams and claws at the ground as he is dragged backwards towards the shadow of the tree behind him. **"Run, vol_tage2002! Run for your life!**"
The last thing anyone hears coming from the shadows is the sound of a kitty purring and lightly clawing at the new toy Zerah has captured for herself, as well as the occasional "ouch" from Korihor as his legs are slowly clawed.*
Hi vol_tage2002! I'm one of the insane ones around here! ;D

Wait...you mean there are non-insane people around here!? :P

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-13 23:21:38)

Welcome.
And, yes, there are non-insane people around here. Don"t you see them hiding in the shadows? They watch and laugh at us.

### **zerah** (2009-06-14 01:26:11)

~bursts out of the shadows, now done with the previous play-thing to bypass the toys and catnip to pounce on the new person with welcoming glee~ HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NEW PERSON! ~hugs and runs of to grab the toys and pounce on Tru, then Yogi, then finally land on Ro and purr happily~

Props to Anthrax for the "no batted eyelids" response. As you can see, you get used to it.
