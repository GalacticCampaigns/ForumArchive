Well just thought I would intro myself. I have been playing Saga for a while even a bit online. I live in Seattle WA, in my early 40's and married.
Well that is all for now. I am going go check out the games and browes for a while.

Let's see, you've met Zerah, so you've experienced the most dangerous of us. Welcome. Glad to have another adult here. *sneaks a look around for Zen*
Some folks around here are just kids. You have to learn to ignore them some times. ;D
