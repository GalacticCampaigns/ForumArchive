### **thelastfool** (2008-06-05 17:32:12)

I'm just trying to warn him. Zerah and Bob are loose, and John might show up at any moment. plus since he's new i don't see any point in lying to him.

### **zerah** (2008-06-05 19:04:31)

I am behaving...Bob's just jealous >.>

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-05 19:05:57)

No, I just don't think you should maul the new arrival. Not until he's been here at least a week. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

---

### **zerah** (2008-06-05 19:13:46)

I'm not mauling! I'm giving a friendly pounce ~nods~

### **thelastfool** (2008-06-05 19:53:07)

~puts Zerah on a leash and hands it to Alicia~ here hold onto her until her master comes to get her

---

### **zerah** (2008-06-05 22:22:51)

~pouts~ I thought you owned me last? John hasn't bought me yet.

### **ganthet** (2008-06-09 19:34:29)

Wow! Well i got nothing to add to this other then to say Hi to the new guy. Hey how put Sam on a leash? (Throws Sam some cat nip.) That should calm her down abit.

### **zerah** (2008-06-09 19:48:08)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-17 03:11:09)

So whats up with the cat thing Zerah has going for her?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-21 18:08:35)

I think you'll get used to it eventually. Even though I haven't :

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-21 18:46:46)

The point where you start to "get used to it" is actually the point where your sanity has ebbed past the point of no return.

---

### **zerah** (2008-06-21 20:41:35)

>.> I's a kitty <.<

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-21 23:23:33)

The prime example.

---

### **thelastfool** (2008-06-23 02:04:21)

Zerah is a kitty. and there is no such thing as sanity here
