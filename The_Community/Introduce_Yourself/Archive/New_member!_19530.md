Hi everyone here is Eagleyes or Eagle. Iâ€™m Brazilian and play tabletob RPG for 8 years. Is difficult find GMs here so I came here to find some that could GM for me. English is not my birth language so sometimes I can make some language mistakesâ€¦
Iâ€™m GMing a Dawn of Defiance here but itâ€™s in Portugueseâ€¦ maybe you can LOL because it's funny to see a SWSE game in a different language.

Your English is better than some people I know whose first language IS English, so don't worry about it.
In other news, welcome to the site.

I wasn't refering to you. Yours is just fine. I was refering, more specifically, to those who either use "Leet Speak" or who.... just can't be bothered to become basically literate in English, even though they live (and were born) in a country that uses it as a primary language. Like North America.
