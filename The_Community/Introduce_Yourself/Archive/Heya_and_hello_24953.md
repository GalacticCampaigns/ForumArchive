Welcome! Glad you have come to join us!
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). When you find a game, you're next step is to contact the GM and take a look to see if the game is already in progress. Most of the games are currently active, so it would be a good idea to look through them to see if it turned out to be the sort of game which interests you.
Should you have any questions, our community is exceedingly helpful and don't find it a bother to help their fellows out. Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not, someone will pop in if you linger just to meet you.

So google delivered this guy
Who is warmly cheerful and spry
We'll test him a bit
See if he'll split
Then offer his corpse to the sky

The Sky Gods are not amused
by your efforts to leave me bemused
Your verdict is in
You've committed a sin
And are sentenced to be felinely abused.
