Because we don't want you to hurt Zerah.
Welcome btw!

Besides, I don't think blasters work on Zerah. She's too quick to pin down.

That would be why you need the water pistol....
That, and if you use the blaster, we'll roast you over a spit.

"Wow Bob you seem a lil hostile there buddy."
Fett picks himself up and dusts himself off. Grabs squirt gun and start hunting ninja kitty for a lil payback

Umm, no. Not hostile. You don't wanna see me when I'm hostile.
