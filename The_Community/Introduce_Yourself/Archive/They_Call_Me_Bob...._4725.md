# They Call Me Bob....

....and I have no idea why. It's not even my name. And I really prefer Tim....
I'm new to the site (obviously) after finding my way here from the Links page of the SWAG site (Star Wars Artists Guild.) SWAG is an Awesome site, by the by.
EDIT: It would be more accurate to say that I found my way here from the page my browser kicked out after it failed to load the SWAG links page. It has this.... interesting habit of kicking out random related links when it's not able to connect to a particular website. Sometimes those links are relevent (like the one that lead me here) and sometimes they're.... just wierd. Like the one that redirected me to a women's health site detailing STD's when I was looking for images of custom lightsaber hilts....
It seems that this is a youngish forum, which suits me just fine as newish communities are easily corrupted to the dark si.... err.... easily joined.
I'm looking to get into some SAGA PbP games, perhaps some of the old D20 RCR games, if they start up. There seems to be a general lack of both in the various places I play in.

Tim .... .... ... ?
Do you make things explode in firey displays?
And are you afraid of small white rabbits?
:
Welcome, Bob!
You know, I'm gonna call you George now, I think.
Welcome George!

Hmm.... no explodey business, as far as I know. And the only thing I'm afraid of is Shrodingers Cat! I mean seriously! It's a freakin' undead cat! :

Indeed, welcome to the forums. I might be jump-starting my game back up. Anyway, glad to have more people to discuss the movies and the game with.

An undead cat that can strike you down with powers of confusion without ever emerging from the confines of its box prison.

The very thought is enough to make the bravest of King Arthur's knights flee!

"The Brave Sir Robin! He bravely turned around, and he bravely ran away!"
"Shut up!!"
