# Saronian reporting for duty

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-05 06:34:54)

Hey all,
My name is Saronian. I'm in the US Army, working though my 4th year of a 7 ( almost 8 ) year enlistment. Currently in a Dawn of Defiance campaign (which I won't use to my advantage ::) ). Normally play a jack of all trades or an infantry type guy.

Welcome to the site
Sounds a lot like my usual playstyles, although I think IÂ´ve tried the most on this site.
Hopefully youÂ´ll be able to find a game to play in, otherwise you can just hang around, or perhaps even start a game of your own.

Don't worry, I ready the other posts.
So what campaigns are either going on, dead in the water, or starting up?

To see what games are starting up, check the "Casting Call" section under the respective forums. Check for the ones that arenÂ´t closed and the ones that have had activity in the last few days.
To see what games are running, just check through the various forums

Never let it be said I'm a complete and total cold, heartless b******.
I'm only a partial one.
