# New Recruit Reporting For Duty

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-01 03:39:16)

Greetings!
My name is Radon. I used to frequent the WOTC SWRPG boards back around the time ROTS came out. I've been in a few SW PbP games since then, but unfortunately only had one or two that lasted long enough due to one reason or another. I've only just recently heard about the Saga Edition, but I decided to take a chance to crash head-on to the updated and surprisingly compact system. I'm pleasantly surprised to note that the admins have plans for a Living Force campaign on this board, and as someone who came in a bit too late for the original Living Force, I'm certainly very interested in that particular project (even if it's on hold). I see there's also a sanctioned RPGA Dawn of Defiance campaign group here, though it's a bit disappointing to know the slots have been filled (I still haven't gotten to use my 2-year-old RPGA number! lol).
In any case, I hope to game with you all sometime. So, if any current GMs are reading this and are looking for a player who specializes in creating and portraying characters that round out the cast ("the bard in a party of 6" type), I'd be more than happy to see what I can do for you.

P.S. To the admins: Would it be possible to change my username to have a capital R and A, if it's not too much to ask? I thought there would be an option to change one's displayed name, but alas I could not find one.

A bit late, yes, but 2-year RPGA number? I've had Herald-level GM since 2001, I think, and haven't used it at all! A few friends of mine were trying to get a Living Greyhawk thing together but that fell through. The RPGA sounds great in theory, but I wish I could see it in practice!
