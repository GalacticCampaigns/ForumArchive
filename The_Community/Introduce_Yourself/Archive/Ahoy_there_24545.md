# Ahoy there

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-10 12:49:08)

Hi everyone, I'm Jedi Comedian (real name Josh), and if you visit the Wizards SWRPG boards you might have seen me post there. I'm looking to play in a Star Wars Saga Edition game since the last online campaign I was involved with seems to have died a death. My favourite era is Rebellion, since I'm an OT fan (though who isn't?), but I enjoy playing in other eras as well.
Out in the real world, I'm a student journalist living with my fiancée in London, UK (though I originally hail from Sheffield). I enjoy reading, playing video games, eating sandwiches, and, of course, Star Wars.
So if anyone has a game in need of a player, let me know. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Welcome, there's a rebellion era game looking for players [Here](http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=24543 "http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=24543"). Though that is infinities so it may not be what you're looking for.

I don't mind an Infinites game, sounds like fun. Thanks.

Ah yes, I knew I had seen that name somewhere...a long time ago, on a forum far far away...
Anyway, welcome, and if you are looking for games, I´ll probably reopen one or two casting calls in the coming days.

Brace for impact, JC!
BTW, Catnip Grenade would be a great name for a band.

Thanks for all the replies everyone. I was a little worried that you wouldn't take kindly to a newcomer, but my fears have certainly be allayed.

Well, I personally am waiting to see at least a whole episode before I pass any judgement on him. My fiancee hates him, purely for not being as handsome as David Tennant. But the trailer after End of Time looked good, and Steven Moffat at the helm is a good omen.
