Hello all --
I'm a 32 year old Ph.D. student in Columbus OH. I haven't done pbp games before, but it seems like a great approach. I've been reading some of the game logs in the forum and am excited to get on board with one. I've played the Star Wars RPG before, but it was years and years ago with the original West End rules. So there's gonna be a little bit of learning involved for me, but it shouldn't be too bad...
Cheers!

Hey and welcome to the site =)
If you haven´t played PbP or SAGA Edition before, don´t worry since both are really easy to learn. Also, don´t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Everyone in this community is great, and will surely do their best to help you. If you´ve checked around a bit on the forums already, I´m sure you´ve noticed all the threads located beneath the game forums. Those are casting calls, and they´re your best shot for getting started. Look for one that says (Open) in its title, check it out, and if you´re interested, send in a character. Questions are best directed at the person who started the casting call, or anyone currently in that game.
Now I´ll bail from this thread, before the crazy greeting mob arrives. Oh, and you´re not allergic to cats, are you?

Howdy and welcome! Part of the new member tradition is holding on to this here sphere that looks suspiciously like a grenade. Don't worry, it isn't one. *hands live catnip grenade*

Welcome! OO, a local! I have't seen you around at any cons have I? Glad you have come to join us!
DA is very right in that our community is very helpful and you'll be hard pressed to find someone who won't be willing to help you through character creation and the like for any of the games.
Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not someone will pop in if you linger to meet you.

Welcome!
Maybe instead of learning the new rules you could just twist Sketch's arm and make him run a d6 game! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
