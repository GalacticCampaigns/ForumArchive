How do I see the rest of the forums? What do I need to do to get access?

Burne you were one of five members who we were placed in the group manually and have to be manually taken out in a couple minutes after this post you shall have full access again.
Welcome back!
If you haven't seen them already, the casting calls are listed in the forums for the pbp games, look for games with titles which say (open). It's very exciting to see another prospective GM in our midst and I know I'm not the only one who will say that I'm excited to see what sort of gaming experience you have brought to our community.
Feel free to jump into the chat room, there's generally always someone there, and if not someone will pop in if you linger to meet you.
