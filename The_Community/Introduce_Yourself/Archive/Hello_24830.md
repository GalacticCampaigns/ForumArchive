Welcome
To get started, you should just skim around the Casting Call forums (which I see youÂ´ve already done) and check for games that seems interesting and that are open. Most GMs have added and open/closed notation to their casting calls, but for those that you are unsure whether they are open or not, you can always check the time for the latest activity, or simply ask.

Greetings and welcome!
You will have received a PM which I highly recommend you look at it. DA is correct in that most GMs have now started indicated whether the casting is open/closed. If you have any further questions, we're all willing to lend some advice or answer them.
Pop into the chat room sometime!
