Hello everyone,
I've had an interest in star wars for awhile and relatively recently I've been readin up about d20. And now its at the point where I would like to participate in some RPG.
Given the above I'm afraid I have no experience beyond a little freeform forum RP and a few DMed adventures on a Neverwinter Nights persistent world. I hope you won't mind a d20 newbie appearing and exercising the stereotypical urge to wave a lightsaber around a bit.
I hope you'll enjoy RPing with me <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Is there a particular section in which I can ask about Play by post d20 mechanics? <!-- s:? -->![:?](https://i.ibb.co/KcdH3QwT/icon-e-confused.gif)<!-- s:? -->

Hey and welcome <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
There are no specific rules we have set up here, it kind of varies from game to game. Read up on some of the games going - you should have access to most forums - or read the PbP histories section.

Hello and welcome.
The thing about pbp post gaming is that it isn't really that different from tabletop gaming - at least in how it works. You declare your actions, you might have to remind your GM how the mechanics work out-of-character, and then the GM resolves the act and any responses to it.
This all happens in the form of in-character (IC) or in-game (IG) text, and out-of-character (OOC) or out-of-game (OOG) commentary.
One note before I continue - If you've got any background in chatroom roleplaying, forget the formatting you learned there - it's likely to be inappropriate for pbp.
IC/IG text is your character's actions, speech, and thoughts. It is written how you would write a story.
OOC/OOG commentary is YOU. If you need to tell the GM the specific mechanics of your actions, ask a question about what you can and can't do, or make any other comment or query, this is how you do it. Different players come from different backgrounds and therefore have different ways of highlighting the parts of their post that are OOC/OOG. Myself, I surround it with double brackets.
*<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">An example:</span>
Merz glances down at his blaster in horror.* Out of power, at a time like this! And no time to reload, there are too many of them. *He has no choice but to risk a tactic that could prove fatally stupid in his current environment. Staying low behind the cover of the pipes, trying not to let the concentrated blaster fire of the stormtrooper squad phase him, he pulls a grenade from a pocket on the front of his utility belt. He takes a calming breath, presses the activation pad, and tosses it over the pipes towards the stormtroopers.
((OOC: That translates to a move action to retrieve the grenade, a swift action to activate his Second Wind and heal some of that damage he took in the firefight, and a standard action to attack with his grenade - aiming at where the stormtroopers are most packed in.))*
As for other mechanics, there's not really such a thing as turn-taking, though your GM might require you post in initiative order during combat rounds. Like tabletop play, you can do or say as much as you want and your GM allows, but remember to be courteous and not post so much that other players are left behind and unable to accomplish things - it's their game and their fun as well as yours.

Thanks for the quick replies <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
One question I had was rerolling - This is used quite often in Saga Edition and I wanted to know how it works. Are you told the result of the roll (as in success or fail) and so the reroll can be employed or is it just that the number rolled is a bit low so one can reroll to try and get a better number?

Thanks, for the info - so script format isn't used at all here?
And I see there's a fresh Saga edition game recruiting, if you don't mind a newb I may apply soon :

The process for this may differ from GM to GM. One might tell you, while another won't.

Not in any pbp game I've ever taken part in here or anywhere else, at least.
> And I see there&#39;s a fresh Saga edition game recruiting, if you don&#39;t mind a newb I may apply soon :

I don't have an objection to anyone applying, but I expect the same standards in any application no matter who the applicant is. You might want to have a look at some older casting calls for example applications to model yours on. Mine are a good start, probably, since I give other GMs what I would like to see myself. Which is not to say you have to hand me a short story for a history like I often do, but I wouldn't object if you did.
