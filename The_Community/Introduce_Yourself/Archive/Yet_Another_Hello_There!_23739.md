# Yet Another Hello There!

Hi! Just joined after seeing this message board plugged on the Wizards' Star Wars Saga boards.  I'm currently GMing a Saga campaign and joined looking for ideas. 
Also, wouldn't mind getting in on a Play-by-Post game.  Been years since I've done that.

If you see her, use this!  *Hands over a fire hose*
