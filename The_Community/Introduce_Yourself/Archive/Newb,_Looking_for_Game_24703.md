# Newb, Looking for Game

### **Anonymous** (2010-06-16 22:08:00)

Hey, completely new to Pen & Paper D&D and how to set stuff up, interested in joining a game who is patient with a noob, and would't mind teaching me the ropes as we go along. Willing to observe a couple games before getting in with a character to learn how things work. Have not made a character yet, hoping for a default template before I make my own.

Welcome to the community, Zaex! We're always looking for eager players looking to expand their horizons in the realm of online pen and paper games. Don't hesitate to ask the mods and other members for any advice.
Feel free to stop into the chat room and we can definitely give you some help in getting started. Keep an eye out on the casting calls. Sketchpad I believe may be looking for players for his new Mutants and Masterminds and Pathfinder campaigns.

Thank you, Where might I find this chat room? And I am primarily seeking for Star Wars related games only. The genre intrigues me, and I can't see myself playing any other fantasy types. Once I get comfortable with D&D I might expand to other forms of D&D other than Star Wars, but for not, Star Wars only.

When logged in, there's a link near the top right (using the default template of DivineBlack), which says "Chat Room". It's member access only so you need to log in.
Moving this thread to Introduce Yourself forum.
