# Salutations, all.

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-10 10:19:57)

Hello everyone, I found this place via Alicia's sig on the Wizards forums. I've been involved in PbP clubs for years, and this is the first I've found that even mentions ORPG, so I'm hoping I'll find a game to play here. I've tried running them before but it always ends up failing due to scheduling and lack of player commitment. Anyway, here's hoping this will be the beginning of a long and fruitful friendship.

### **Anonymous** (2008-07-31 23:43:47)

you could join the game I'm starting, in rebellion era Roots of Crime
I really wanna see a pilot cause I love to run starship battles, but you wouldn't be restricted to anything.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-02 16:17:48)

I love playing pilots! Count me in.
I'm leaving tomorrow for holidays, and will be back a week from this coming Tuesday. Will that hold up your game?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-02 17:56:03)

No, a week from tueday's fine. I'm waiting for someone to post a character anyways. Besides, I still have some planning to do

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-03 12:18:35)

Any character creation guidelines I should follow? Is there a forum already?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-03 12:48:48)

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 19:49:31)

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 19:54:28)

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 19:57:21)

hmm, if he was so god like, then how was he killed by his own troops, if he was so powerful, he would have sensed it like yoda :P
we've been using smileys every post <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 20:02:03)

Who ever said it was actually Master Koon?? <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> He could have ejcted prior and been in hiding like Vash after he was considered to be killed. Or Obi wan when cody called him dead after he fell from the mountain side...there is still a chance :

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 20:05:26)

so hopeful. but, it is canon that he died. :P
revan on the other hand, has no canon death. In fact, we don't know what happened to him. For all anyone knows, he could be alive, albiet 4000 years old. :P

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 20:09:13)

Was Revan so god like that he forsaw Malak shooting his command bridge and taking the mantle of Sith Lord?? =]-- They won't kill Revan due to wanting to create more games due to him being the mina character everyone wants to play again. :
