Just following the instructions!
I'm 30, I'm married, and I'm a Christian in Atlanta, GA.
I stumbled over to these boards from the WotC ones for a play by post.
Yay for finally getting to play Star Wars! (And not having to DM it!)

welcome new person
oh btw, might I ask you look at the kalium galaxy stuff? we are creating it, and it's always good to have more eyes and brains.

Welcome to the forums! Nice to have someone else from Ga here lol. There are lots to do here from running your own game to playing in one, and just as SacredPhoenix said, the Kalium Galaxy is ripe for the picking right now. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Oh yeah, sorry about that. I forgot to warn you about our resident pouncer, Zerah. Shes pretty harmless, specially if you have this.

Thanks for all the warm welcomes!
I haven't looked at the new world stuff yet.
The forums seem much more personable than WotC, more like Paizo from my days over there. A welcome change!
Thanks again,
