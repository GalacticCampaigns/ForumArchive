Hi!
In a nutshell: My name is Felix, I'm a 22 year old french canadian student in History and International Relations.
I first started role-playing games in 2002 with the release of the Star Wars RCR, since then I've mostly played D&D and a bit of other systems. Of course, as soon as Saga came out I switched systems, sadly, in 6 years I've played about 15 Star Wars game sessions since my friends mostly prefer D&D. As an avid fan of Star Wars I've been itching to play for a while and hopefully I'll be able to satiate my thrist for some some Star Wars RPG. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Welcome to the site! You should easily be able to get in a game here. It seems one is starting up every couple of weeks. Keep an eye out on the casting calls.
