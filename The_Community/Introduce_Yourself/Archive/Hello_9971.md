Hello,
I am Richard, and I am here looking to see if i can find an online Star Wars RCR game... Not only because I can not afford the Saga Edition books on my current financial status (i have to make my VA disability check provide for my wife, two sons and myself), but i honestly prefer the RCR to what i have seen when i read through the SE stuff (not to mention the fact i am still upset how WotC handled the transition to the new system while stating that they were not scrapping the RCR until rigth before the SE annoucement).

Welcome to the forums Richard! I'm not sure you will have much luck finding an RCR game here either. To my knowledge every game currently being played is Saga edition. If you wanted you could try to start a RCR game up yourself, you may get some players who liked those rules though I can't promise anything.

Hey Richard! Welcome to the site. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Like Rowen said you might not find a RCR game but you will find a lot of support if you get into a saga game. Good luck

The only problem with a Saga Ed game is that i don't have the money for the book. If someone would be willing to help convert (or build) Val-EL to Saga Ed rules i'd be more than willing to try my hand at Saga.

Hello everyone,
I'm sorry I dropped out of sight for so long. But I have a really good excuse. On 23 July 2008 I was in a really bad car wreck on my way to a doctor's appointment. The wreck ripped me up really bad, the guardrail cut my legs off and left me in a week and half long coma. When I had awoken from the coma I discovered they had been able to reattach and rebuild my legs and reinflate my left lung. They said I had died on the Operating Table and twice more during the coma. They put me on life support for a while. But I crawled back from death, and fought my way back to walking again. All for the goal of being with my wife and sons in the UK, only to have that removed as an option. No matter how much my sons want me to be with them, it's something that won't be happening since she has found someone else. It was goal because when i awoke from the coma Emma had called me and told me to get well enough to get back to her and the boys. That she loved me and just wanted me to get back to the UK to be with her and our sons. But that all changed in January, she had said she wanted a divorce and that she had started to see someone else. I was able to see the boys in May, and my four year old asked if i was finally home to stay with him and Zachary (who turned two in May) and when I told him I couldn't stay. He said he knew it was "Because of mummy and tom." Zachary is only two and knows I am his daddy, despite the fact he hadn't seen me in a year, he knew me. And they had said he wasn't a cuddle baby anymore because he didn't like to be held. But he kept coming and getting in my lap to play and for me to just hold him. A day doesn't go by that I don't miss them, that I don't hurt so bad that I'm not with them. I have been told that I one day they will choose to be with me. And I hope and pray they are right, because there are times I really wish they hadn't brought me back. Because this isn't living anymore. It's just existing. I guess that's why I'm back, looking for something to do to pass the time. To try to take my mind away from how much I hurt, how much I miss my boys.

First; thank God your still here. Something must be in store for you here because you made it through that.
Second; Damn man, that sucks. Pardon my language, don't take offense, and with all due respect, but she's a frakking whore for pulling that stunt. Hope she gets what she deserves, but that's just me.
As for games, there's two in the Rise of the Empire (Master Silverback's and mine, when I get it going), as well as a dew in other eras. I'll leave a spot open if you want in, just consult the Spark of the Alliance thread for details.
Again, thank god you made it. Not very many people can say they have done that.

Thank you. I'd love to play. I still love her, i believed her. I can't believe She did this. I forgave her, but it hasn't stopped this pain. It's still here. still hurting. I miss my sons so damn bad.
