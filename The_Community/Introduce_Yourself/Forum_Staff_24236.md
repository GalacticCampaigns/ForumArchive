Galactic Campaigns has come a long way from its roots as Galactic Adventures. We have grown and established a great community for Star Wars Saga discussion and Play-by-Post games. It has grown so much in fact that I am unable to keep up with everything and still enjoy the game that spurred me to create this site. So I made the choice (with Simply pushing.....err I mean backing me) to add more moderators to the site to help lighten the load. The moderators for Galactic Campaigns are:
**Alicia** - Virtual Tabletop Forum Moderator
**Anazider** - New Republic Era and Legacy Era Forum Moderator
**Darthanthrax** - Old Republic Era and Rise of the Empire Era Forum Moderator
**Yogi** - Rebellion Era, New Jedi Order Era and General Forum Moderator
Please bring any complaints or concerns for the site to the appropriate forum Moderator. If they are unable to handle your concerns or problem please contact the Global Moderators who are:
**Master Tru**
**Yogi**
If the Global Moderators are unable to satisfactorily help your situation please contact the Site Administrator who is:
**Rowen**
**Alicia**
