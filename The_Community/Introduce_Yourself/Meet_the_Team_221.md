Creator and Administrator
**Position entails:** Making the rules; and being the highest authority when rules are broken or during member disputes. As well as ensuring the site is running smoothly.
**Nationality:** United States (Georgia)
**Galactic Campaigns:** After Effects (Fin)
**Other Info:** A practicing nurse working the surgical floor, Rowen sometimes has some weird schedules: If you ever see him posting late at night, you know why! He is 35 years old, and is married with 4 children. His roleplaying experience before the advent of Saga Edition is primarily in D&D, though he did own several RCR books he never used. He owns several other RPGs, but never had a gaming group to play them with, spurring him to create the Star Wars: Galactic Adventures forum. You can see the success of that bright idea right here in the brand new Star Wars: Galactic Campaigns community.

**Position entails:** Pretty much the same as all the other moderators. Also responsible for the Vehicles/Technology sections in the Kalium Galaxy.
**Moderates:** The Old Republic and Rise of the Empire Era Forums.
**Nationality:** Swedish
**Favorite Era and System:** Old Republic Era. SAGA Edition, but will always have a special place for Call of Chtullu/Delta Green, due to hilarious memories from the past.

**Other Info:** As of writing moment 23 years old, and currently studying Computer Engineering with a few years left. Loves RPGs, but had quite some trouble finding people to ply with before I joined here, which I was the 3rd person to do, only Rowen and Tru beat me to it. If it is SW or Fantasy, you can probably get me interested. Also loves to experiment with creating new rules or expanding existing ones. On a final note, IÂ´ve spent 10 months receiving military training from the Swedish Ranger Corps.

**Position entails:** Just about anything except running the site itself! Mostly settling disputes and enforcing rules; assisting in the creation and management of new rules and projects (such as the Itara Project); and most importantly being a lone voice of reason in what is otherwise a complete madhouse.
**Nationality:** England
**Favorite Era and System:** Rebellion Era and Legacy Era; The Window (for non-Star Wars) and Saga Edition (for Star Wars). Currently rather enjoying the Smallville RPG, as well as tinkering with my own system Dragane.
**Games:** *Drakensban: End Times*, a game of epic fantasy; *Gotham Genesis*, a game of superheroic origins.
**Other Info:** simplyscribed is 23, and currently lives the awkward life of the terminally unemployed. He has been roleplaying since he was nine, and though he isn't certain, he thinks he's improved. Apart from spending his time looking for work, writing, and drinking cheap booze, he enjoys the hobby of pretending to be someone he isn't and wishes he could be paid to do it.
