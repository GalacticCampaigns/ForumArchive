# AetherCon Online RPG Convention

### **MichaelColes** (2012-01-27 06:22:52)

Grab your virtual dice bags folks and mark down November 16-18, 2012 on your calendar, the AetherCon Online RPG Convention is coming to your computer.
We will be featuring tabletop RPGs of all types throughout the weekend highlighted by four three day tournaments of Pathfinder, Call of Cthuhlu, Savage Worlds, and Shadowrun.
Additionally vendors, industry guests, and artists are also in our plans. We will be releasing free downloadable wallpapers throughout the months leading up to the con. You can see them find the first two, Gormic ‘Pretty’ Nangalmaar as done by White Wolf featured artist Brian LeBlanc and Klandeggin Moltenfist illustrated by Andre Freitas Cardozo here.
All of our events will be run using the Traipse next generation virtual tabletop and its companion browser-based web-client. Both are currently under development with the Beta version of Pious Paladin having been already released. These programs will make it possible for a player to simply click on a link on the event website and ‘sit down at the table’ as it were as opposed to having to download, install, and boot up a separate program as was the case in the past. We are also planning for voice chat games using Skype technology for some events.
Be sure to visit our websites and show your support for AetherCon via Facebook and Twitter.
