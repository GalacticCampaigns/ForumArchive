Sure enough. Rowan kills the Fan Fiction area, and I suddenly get the writing bug. Go figure.
Anyhow, for you enjoyment:
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Fate of the Galaxy</span>**
â€œThis sucks, ya know?â€ Den said as he planted a foot on the corpseâ€™s charred chest. So braced, he pulled back on the hilt of the sword, creating a horrible scrapping noise and the blade grinded against the metal like ribs of the brastle. Once the blade was free, the man inspected the gray metal of the blade and the black blood that clung to it like sap. He thumbed the activation button, and raised an eyebrow when it refused to hum.
â€œIt was a long battle. What do you expect?â€ Rikki breathed, not expecting an answer. â€œWhat sucks? The smell? Or that we have to walk back?â€ She was seated on a blasted stump, the fire that had burned the surrounding corpses having started by the missing part of the tree. The weapon that had torn away the tree wasnâ€™t among the rifles that clung to Denâ€™s back. Itâ€™s ammunition spent, he had discarded that particular cannon hours ago.
â€œYeah, those suck, too,â€ her partner answer. He tripped over a displaced limb on his way back to her. He scowled at the leg, still wrapped in the blue and yellow uniform of the Imperial Consortium, as if it had meant to trip him. He shrugged his shoulder, rattling the weapons as he did, and seemed to consider the trek back to their starting point. A weary sigh escaped his lips.
â€œSo, what are you complaining about this time?â€ Rikki asked. Den bowed low, holding the blade level to the ground in his outstretched hands as if he were a student handing a blade back to his master. She accepted the unpowered vibroblade without ceremony, and tossed it toward its three sisters at her feet. They too, were unpowered and covered in bristle ichors.
â€œThe frakking kid,â€ Den answered. Rikki rubbed her shoulders and grimaced. Den took the hint and walked behind her to start massaging her back. She was happy he had learned, finally, which muscles she needed worked on. She closed her eyes as he went to work, blocking out the view of the battle field and the smell, and focused on the silence and the feel of Denâ€™s fingers on her back.
â€œHm,â€ she sighed. â€œThat almost makes the battle worth it.â€
â€œYeah, I bet. So when do I get a back rub?â€ he asked. She smiled and opened her eyes to stare at the clouds.
â€œWhen you get off your lazy but and pick up a real weapon,â€ she replied. Despite the ugly smoke clawing its way up into the sky, the clouds were a clean white against the blue field.
â€œThese are real weapons,â€ he retorted. â€œBlas-techâ€™s best, modified by yours truly. Modern. Advanced. A weapon for the modern man.â€ The argument was as old as their partnership; only the words changed. â€œAnd much cleaner, I might add. A lady of stature might consider using one. At least then she might not be covered in gore at the end of the day.â€
â€œSo itâ€™s a womanâ€™s weapon, eh?â€ she chided. â€œThat would explain it.â€
â€œStepped right into that one,â€ she could hear the grin in his voice. She dropped her gaze back to the battlefield.
â€œUh huh. Hey, is that tank yours or mine?â€ The armor in question was a hundred paces away, its yellow markings barely visible under the ash. Dozens of dismembered bodies separated the pair and the tank. Idly, she wondered what happened to the turret.
â€œThat one? Uhâ€¦I think itâ€™s yours. Yeah. Yours. You can see the cut above the left tread,â€ he answered. She tired finding the cut he mentioned, but it just looked like a slagged tank to her. â€œYou got it through the ammo bin, which is why it exploded.
â€œYou can see it, maybe,â€ she closed her eyes and went back to enjoying Denâ€™s work. â€œI canâ€™t.â€
â€œWhy am I working with someone so short-sighted, anyway? â€œ he asked.
â€œNothing is wrong with my vision; I just donâ€™t make my living shooting wings off flies at two hundred paces.â€
â€œNo, you just castrate them with knives at twenty paces.â€ She felt his irritation rise again. His complaints were his method of relieving stress after a battle, like that massage was for her. Rikki knew he didnâ€™t see it that way, take it was some character flaw on his part. But she knew better, and she did her part to help.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€
He sighed, and moved his hands to her lower back. She decided he could complain about anything, provided he keeps up the massage. â€œThe kid. Us. I dunno. Itâ€™s stupid.â€
â€œMore than likely,â€ she agreed. â€œBut go ahead.â€
â€œNah. Itâ€™s not important.â€
â€œDen,â€ she said as she lifted her head, her voice laced with exasperation. â€œIf I have to stop you from rubbing my back for you to tell me whatâ€™s wrong, I am going to be ticked.â€
â€œOh, save me from that,â€ he chuckled, but his finger kept at her sore muscles. â€œOkay. The kid. Heâ€™s a Jedi, right?â€
â€œYeah,â€ she said, lowering her head.
â€œSo, he meditates for a few years, wonders about the nature of the universe, and heâ€™s the frakking star of the galaxy.â€
â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ she asks. â€œSince when are you worried about fame?â€
â€œIâ€™m...not really,â€ he denied. â€œButâ€¦here, look up.â€ Rikki did as asked. â€œLook at this valley. How many ickies you think we toasted. Two thousand? Four thousand?â€ The battle had started several kilometers ahead of them, and the pair had conducted a retreating battle all morning and well into the afternoon. Corpses of men and vehicles lay scattered the whole distance, piles her and there where Den or her had found a cluster of the Imperial Consortium- ickies, as Den liked to call them- troops. Hulked tanks, APCs, and broken speeders still smoked where they had crashed. Broken trees, ashen ground, and burned shrubbery filled in the spaces between the bodies. Such sights she was used to, and she was growing used to the idea all of this was her fault. Herâ€™s and Denâ€™s. Even the smell was getting to be tolerable. But she didnâ€™t have to like it.
â€œMe? I did about two grand. You got about five hundred or so.â€
â€œFunny,â€ his voice was sulky. She waited for him to continue, but Den kept his silence. Finally, she admitted defeat.
â€œAlright. Four thousand. And some armor. And you took out some speeders. Whatâ€™s your point?â€
â€œCan you think of anyone else who could have done this? Who else could have taken on a division of ickies, on open ground, and come out with just some sore muscles and spent power packs?â€ He stopped rubbing her back as his argument over took him. He moved in front of her to point at the carnage. â€œI can think one, maybe two, who might be able to pick a fight like this. But, if they survived, they would be in a bacta tank, sucking on a hose and hoping their arms grow back straight.â€
â€œOkay,â€ Rikki had to agree. She wasnâ€™t about to argue. Four thousand dead ickies canâ€™t be wrong,she thought with a wiry grin.
â€œAndâ€¦it doesnâ€™t matter,â€ he sighed and dropped his arm. â€œWhen history looks back on this, theyâ€™ll say the little kid Jedi took on the IC, powered by the Force, and changed the fate of the galaxy. Weâ€™ll be foot notes.â€ He raised his hands as if to brace his next words with his fingers. â€œJedi Boy! And company. Guess who the â€˜companyâ€™ is, Rikki?â€
â€œDenâ€¦â€ she breathed. But her partner wasnâ€™t done yet.
â€œAnd why is that? Because he has â€˜special powersâ€™? The â€˜Forceâ€™ guides him?â€ He turned away, and looked across the battlefield. â€œHe can sense danger, seconds before it happens. We have that kind of intuition, but it took us years in a combat zone to pick that up.â€ He waved his hand toward her pile of vibroblades. â€œHow long have you been training with a blade, Rikki? Ten years? Fifteen?â€
â€œThirty,â€ she said softly. He was touching feelings she had pushed away but never came to terms with. â€œSince I was three.â€
â€œThirty years. And you practice every day,â€ he said, dropping his tone to match hers. He had noticed her own jealousy, and her shame for that jealousy. â€œBut, since the Force chose him, he can match your speed, your grace, and with the future sensing crap, he is your equal. And heâ€™s still doesnâ€™t have to shave everyday.â€
â€œAnd you?â€ she asked. â€œYou ace eyeballs at the maximum range of any rifle you pick up, but you couldnâ€™t hit him if you tried.â€ He had been shooting for as long as she could hold a blade. â€œHurts you too, doesnâ€™t it?â€
He shrugged away his side of the issue. â€œIt only bothers me when my target is something like him. But youâ€¦aw, frak, Rikki. Heâ€™s got all this crap going for him, and he doesnâ€™t have any scars to earn it. And heâ€™ll out live us, to boot.â€
â€œOut live us? You got something planned?â€ she asked. â€œCuz if youâ€™re planning on punching the ticket before weâ€™re done with the IC, you got another thing coming.â€
â€œNo, not that.â€ He turned to face her. â€œI did some reading. The Jedi can live decades longer than normal for their species. Sometimes centuries longer. Weâ€™re at the end of our prime, Rikki-girl. Weâ€™re fading out. Heâ€™s just getting started.â€
â€œAnd he hasnâ€™t earned it,â€ Rikki finshed. â€œAll smooth skin and no scars. He hasnâ€™t lost any family in these wars, hasnâ€™t had to sit in a tube to regrow a lost eye, or watch a friend bleed out. Thatâ€™s what bugging you, isnâ€™t it?â€
Den nodded. â€œHeâ€™s got all that power, and he didnâ€™t pay for it. But everyone thinks heâ€™s the hero. Weâ€™re not even talked about, anymore.â€
She stood up and walked to him. She gripped his hand in both of hers, and stared at his face. He kept his eyes on his boots for a time, until he finally relented and met her gaze. Her blue orbs looked deep into his brown, and she saw the hurt he felt. Not for his sake- he always accepted his fate, no matter how unfair- but for her. He put her on a pedestal, years ago, she knew. He didnâ€™t like to see her knocked off of it.
â€œWeâ€™ll leave, then,â€ she said, her tone full of conviction. â€œMe and you, weâ€™ll leave. The IC is on itâ€™s way out. The boy can take care of the rest.â€ She nodded to the carnage around them. â€œThis was their last full division anyhow, right? All he has to do is take on the capital, and we both know thatâ€™s cake. This is our last job here. Weâ€™ll leave.â€
â€œRikkiâ€¦no,â€ he said, shaking his head.
â€œLook, your right. We got our reputation the hard way. We got our scars,â€ she was unwavering. â€œWeâ€™ve earned the right to do as we feel necessary. We could go some where else, pick a new cause to fight for.
Den still shook his head. â€œI start something, I finish it. The ickies are bad news, and theyâ€™ll be gone faster if we stick around.â€
â€œWe donâ€™t need to,â€ she replied.
â€œYes, we do. We havenâ€™t pulled out, even when we were losing. Weâ€™re not starting it now.â€
â€œThen what, Den?â€ she asked. â€œWhat do you want us to do? History will make him out to be the hero, no matter what. Thatâ€™s the deal with Jedi. And heâ€™ll just get more magic powers as he goes. We never will. I canâ€™t change that. You canâ€™t change that.â€
â€œRikki, I know, Iâ€¦Iâ€¦â€ she watched him stumble over the words. She wanted to say more, but nothing came to mind.
â€œWhat do you want, Den?â€ she asked softly. â€œTell me what I can do?â€
He looked at her for a long moment, and then hugged her. She returned his embrace easily. â€œI just wanted you to agree with me, Rikki. And you already did.â€ They stayed that way for a moment, enjoying each otherâ€™s company, until stench started to bother her nose once more. Reluctantly, she pulled away.
â€œSo, youâ€™re good now?â€ she asked. â€œYou okay?â€
â€œYeah, Iâ€™m okay,â€ he answered as he bent to help pick up her swords.
â€œAre you sure you donâ€™t want to split? Maybe take up a new hobby?â€
â€œI fight the good fight, Rikki-girl. Iâ€™m not gonna stop because some unenlightened fools think heâ€™s all that because he can float an apple around." Den paused after that, and his going smile returned to his face. â€œWhy? You got something in mind? Woodworking? Carpentry? I could be a chef."
Rikki quickly shook her head. â€œYou? Holding something sharp? Oh, I donâ€™t think so.â€ She adopted a thoughtful expression as she pushed her blades into the duffle she had carried for them. â€œI was thinkingâ€¦how about trash collecting? You know, sorting out all the cans from the paper. You got good eyes; you can do that.â€
â€œGee, thanks,â€ he replied, shifting his rifles to his other shoulder. â€œI think Iâ€™ll stick to chasing tanks with a pistol. But you could get a second job,â€ he countered. â€œI know! You could wash dishes! Yeah! You could work in my kitchen!â€
She smiled more that the image of Den in an apron than the idea of her hands coated in suds. â€œYour kitchen? How are you going to get a kitchen? You gonna shoot the owner?â€
â€œI know lots of kitchen owners that need to be shot,â€ he replied, and then tripped over a corpse. Keeping to his feet didnâ€™t look easy, in Rikkiâ€™s eye, but he managed. He stared back at the dismembered corpse as he walked away, and almost tripped over another body in the process. â€œOh, yeah. The walk back is really gonna suck.â€
