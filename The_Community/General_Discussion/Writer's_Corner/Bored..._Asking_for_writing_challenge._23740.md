You can go [here](http://www.myth-weavers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=12522 "http://www.myth-weavers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=12522").  They have short story writing challenge each month.  The object is to try to get to 5000 words in one month (or 3000 and submit to a publisher).  Anyway, the topic this month is "Dreams".  I've completed the first challenge, and I'll do the second if I have time.
If you're not really into that, I can come up with something else.

I'm sorry, any story about that would HAVE to be naughty, and I'm not sure what sort of ratings Rowen wants to maintain.
And If I was a real bitch, I could comment how posting that picture at all could be considered sexual harassment, not to mention extremely childish, and should be removed, before some innocent impressionable child should stumble across it. Not to mention no wheres near what I asked for in the first place.

And if I wanted to be a psychiatrist, I would point out that you are the only one of the two of us that finds it particularly "naughty."Â Â  <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->*Â  Freud would have a thing or three to say about that.
How is posting a picture of an orange, freestanding object anything remotely resembling "sexual harassment?"Â  It looks more to me like something you might use for squeezing citrus fruits to make juice.
Now, if I'd posted a picture of a vibrator or something, I'd say you have a grievance.

That's the funny thing about sexual harassment. As its the one that's BEING harassed that decided if its harassment or not. The fact of the matter is to ME it looks like some sort of sex toy, so regardless of what YOU see it as, I'm the one that decided if its appropriate or not. 
And Yes, I've had to sit though a sexual harassment talks a time or two.

I also have a suggestion for you. Not so much of a challenge, but a fun thing. You could look through the "Game History" threads, and convert the records of our old adventures into stories.

I also have the software to install a fan fiction database to the site as well. I wonder if there would be an interest in something like that?
Might be a good idea for the next site poll.....hmmmm.

Clarification: In this story "Rune" is an honorific for a female in service to the royalty of the planet Nichet.
"Welcome, Master Vandar. I hope the trip lacked excitement." King Andral address the Jedi Master. While the King was short by human standards, he was still massive compared to the small green humanoid that stood across from him. His attention momentarily drawn to the tall slender woman who had accompanied Vandar. From her dress, She was clearly another member of the Jedi Order. "But I'm afraid its in vain. As I've told you before, Our laws and traditions on this matter is clear."
"Its a pleasure to speak with you again as well, King Andral." Vandar spoke, unhurried and clearly feeling that the topic of discussion wasn't nearly as closed as the human male made it seem. "The fact that both Lady Acar and Rune Jorind need to be trained in the ways of the Force."
"And Lady Acar can't, and won't abdicate her position, to run off to your Enclave, and Rune Jorind can't and won't renounce her vow of service, to do the same."
"My Lord, If I might speak." The woman finally spoke up for the first time, placing a hand on Master Vandar's shoulder before he could respond. The Jedi Master took a deep breath, having foreseen these events, but still uncertain as to whats to come. "The Jedi Council in they're wisdom has come to solution to this matter, that we're sure you'll find acceptable."
"Varisa, Are you sure? You know how hard Atris took the departure of the Exile. I fear what would happen if she felt you abandoned her as well." Vandar spoke, as before, this is a conversation that had been rehearsed on the long trip to Nichet.
"I know, Master Vandar, but staying by her side isn't my Destiny, I can feel it." Jedi Varisa replied, then turning her attention back to the King. "I will remain here on Nichet, to educate the girls."
Remaining silent while his guests talk amongst themselves, Andral Looked back an forth between them. Then his gaze focus on the woman. "You understand that you'll need to take the same Vow of Service as Rune Jorind?"
"Yes, I am aware of that, Lord Andral."

I don't mean to divert attention away from Avarna 's need but I wanted to see if I could people's opinions on a story I have been writing because of boredom as well.
<span style="font-size: 1.40em;">[Lessons to be Learned](http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dcc9z729_0fv738rcr&amp;hl "http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dcc9z729_0fv738rcr&amp;hl")</span> <- link
I'm using a beloved character I was using for a campaign set in the Rise of the Empire Era / Dark Times. Technically its a back story for her, though once done I may use the content from the sessions to continue it.
So I don't hijack Avarna 's thread further I would appreciate any comments you have to be emailed or PMed to me or you can use my profile to get my IM information:

From the upper gallery, Lady Acar listened to the conversation. Nearby, Rune Jorind and Benear, Acar's suitor, stood also engaged by the important discussion being held below. Acar didn't know what to think of the whole business, being barely more then a child. She was thankful for not being forced to leave her home, but also scared of what the future may hold for her, with the Jedi woman Varisa being her tutor.
*Are we going to get Jedi trainng, mistress?* Rune Jorind spoke into Acar's mind. Even as young as they were, the pair had shared a cradle when they had been born, and even to this day they were inseparable. They had grown up being able to read the others thoughts. Did this have something to do with the Force the Jedi spoke of?
*Father will decide if that is best for us.* Acar replied though the telepathic link and the other girl seemed to be satisfied. She couldn't resist compairing herself to her companion, While Acar had dark blond hair that had never been cut, and blue eyes, Jorind had firey red hair cut much shorter and green eyes. She also quietly lamented the fact that Jorind was slightly more developed.
Why does it matter, You won't become Jedi. Benear scoffed, speaking in Mando, his armored feet leaving distinctive tapping noises on the title floor. While it had been several generations since a Mandalorian ship crashed on they're planet, a few of the noble families had intermarried with the survivors, and refused to leave their ways behind. When we are married, I won't allow you to be Jedi.
Don't try to intimidate us with your warrior ways, Lord Benear. Acar replied instantly in the same language. They've yet to help you pay the dowry, or even make me like you...
The warrior responded quickly, Spinning around he grasped Acar's throat, starting to strangle her. It was hard to see the boy's eyes but there was no denying his strength. But likewise, there was no denying the skill of Jorind. As Benear was making his move, the guardian-playmate moved as well, drawing a stun stick from concealment in her jacket, she struck the armored boy. While his armor deflected most of the energy, enough got though to force the boy to release Acar.
Acar was shocked, Both from need of air, and in suprise that the boy had actually attacked her. Slumping to the ground, she did the only thing she could think of. Using her comlink, she signaled for security.
Jorind wasn't intimidated by the warrior-lord as he turned his attention to her. Holding her stun stick in one hand, and in a low guard position, her eyes focused on Benear's unreadable mask, even as he drew a deadly vibroblade.

"Jorind, Once I'm a member of the Royal Family, I have some special things in mind for you." Benear growled, as he thrust with the Vibroblade, The handmaiden sidestepped to the right,then brought her stun stick to impact in the boy's side, causing him to grunt.
"You will address me as Rune Jorind." The  girl replied, reflexively checking the charge on her weapon, while not taking her attention from Benear. Trained with the stun stick since she was old enough to hold it, Jorind wasn't to be taken lightly even if she was several years younger then her opponent, "You've always thought to highly of yourself."
"Please, The Runes are just the Royal Harem." The Mando stepped forward, as he taunted the girl, slashing at her with his weapon. Jorind wasn't quick enough this time, and a deep red line ran from her shoulder down to her navel. Pushed to her limit, Jorind responded with a flurry of attacks from the stun stick, blow after blow left dents on the boy's chest plate, even as the shocks one after another forced Benear to his knees.
Acar watched as her guardian-playmate defended herself against her suitor, Letting out a scream when the other girl was wounded. Benear finally collapsed in spasms from the overload to his nervous system. Blood continued to soak the front of Jorind's blouse, The loss of blood starting to make her dizzy, And one false step took her over the railing causing her to fall to the court below.

It was some days latter when Jorind finally awoke. She was in a medical bed, probably one of those in the infirmary attached to the palace itself. It was still dark outside, and a few lights flashed on monitoring equipment. Above all else, there was a comfortable and familiar warmth against her left side. The guardian-playmate smiled, as she lightly kissed the cheek of her Mistress. After all this time together, neither of them could sleep without the other near.
******************************************************************
"Are you sure you must leave already, Master Vandar?" Rune Varisa asked, As the smaller humanoid boarded his shuttle. The former Jedi wasn't wearing her robes, but instead wore a long flowing white gown, better fitting to her new rank and responsibilities.
"Yes, I need to leave at once, I feel I'm needed at the Enclave" Vandar replied taking another step up the boarding ramp to the shuttle that brought him and Varisa to Nichet. Stopping for a moment, he turns and rests his hands on his walking stick. "Since your now in Exile for betraying the Order, you'll need to surrender your Lightsaber. I'm sorry Varisa."
"Its Rune Varisa now, Master." the woman replied, She'd expected this even now brought forth a decorated box from behind her back, and held it towards the Jedi. "Its just as well, As I'm expected to learn to use the Kalnar Blade. From what I've seen its close to the Ataru Form. May the Force be with you."
"As with you, Rune Varisa." Vandar replied, taking the box from her, and turning and ascending the ramp.
**************************************************
King Andral watched from a distance, as Varisa said her farewell to the Jedi Master. Despite they're relatively short time together, He found himself being drawn to her beauty and strength of character. But before he could think about this much longer, the woman herself once once again beside him.
"I know this is a difficult time for you, Varisa." Andral started, as he handed her the Ceremonial Kalnar Blade. She took it silently and belted it around her waist.
"I'm conflicted, your highness." Varisa said, taking her place a step behind him. "I feel despair, at being alone and giving up my place in the Jedi Order. But at the same time, I also feel free."
"Your not alone, Varisa." replied the king, as he placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "You have your sisters among the Runes, And you never need to leave my side."
With a nod, Varisa placed a hand on top of his, Then smiled. And the pair of them walked back into the Palace.
